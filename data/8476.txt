In a press conference held on Thursday, Indian Director-General of Military Operations Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said the Indian Army had conducted “surgical strikes” along the LoC to “safeguard” the country. Adding that he had spoken to Pakistan, the DGMO said that they were not planning to conduct any more strikes.

Singh also said that there have been no casualties on the Indian side adding “Significant casualties have been caused to terrorists and those trying to shield them.”

“We have recovered items including GPS which have Pakistani markings. Captured terrorists hailing from PoK or Pakistan have confessed to their training in Pakistan or in Pakistan controlled region,” Singh said referring to the capture of terrorists during infiltration attempts.
