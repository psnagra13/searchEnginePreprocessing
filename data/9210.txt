Medical students advised to check college credentials before admission
A day before admissions were to conclude for undergraduate medical and dental courses in the country, the Union health ministry issued a public notice on Thursday, advising students to cross check credentials of medical colleges given conditional permission.

The Supreme Court appointed Oversight Committee (OC) had provided conditional permission to certain medical colleges across India and asked to fulfil the eligibility criteria before the admissions end, failing which the permission could be withdrawn.

“It is now directed by the OC to keep in abeyance the conditional permission granted to these colleges for 2016-17 that have failed to comply...” the ministry notice read.

“Students desirous of taking admission in the colleges given conditional permission are advised to satisfy themselves from the respective website of the college that it has uploaded desired information on its website and does not fall in the category of colleges that have failed to upload the information and the conditional permission is in abeyance for 2016-17 for that reason.”
