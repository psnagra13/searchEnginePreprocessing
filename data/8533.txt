Fawad Khan to not work in Salman Khan's next?
Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor has been receiving a lot of flak from fans and the media for allegedly ‘pushing’ and ‘hitting’ a journalist who came too close to him at the recent Ganesh visarjan. The actor, his brother Randhir, and son Ranbir have been on the receiving end after a video clip showing their ‘unruly behaviour’ went viral online. In an Exclusive interview with Bombay Times, Rishi vehemently denied the reports saying that he ‘didn’t hit anybody’ and that it was unfortunate that they were being ‘condemned’. Now the journalist who has been identified as a television reporter has broken his silence. Much to everyone’s surprise, the journalist says that he was not pushed or hit, but in fact tripped over his camera wire which got entangled in his foot. He says that the video was ‘cleverly edited’ and states that Ranbir ‘never hit or pushed’ him. He also came to Rishi’s defense saying that that the actor didn’t ask the media personnel to move aside and neither did he push anyone. He went on to say that given the heavy downpour that day and the crowds at the venue, ‘the Kapoor family did not target or misbehave with any media person’.
