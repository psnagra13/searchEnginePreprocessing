Jessica Ennis-Hill: Ex-Olympic heptathlon champion 'close' to decision on retirement
Jessica Ennis-Hill narrowly missed out on retaining her Olympic heptathlon title in Rio

Britain's former Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill has said she is "close" to making a decision about her future in athletics.

Ennis-Hill, 30, hinted at retirement after winning silver at the Rio Olympics in August.

But she said the prospect of appearing at the 2017 World Championships in London, where she won Olympic gold four years ago, was a "definite draw".

"It's the Olympic stadium and I have amazing memories there," she said.

"At the same time, I've had that amazing experience at the stadium and it will be hard to replicate that, but it is definitely a draw."

Ennis-Hill, who missed out on retaining her Olympic title in Rio by 35 points to Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam, said she did not want to rush her decision.

"I have thought about it a lot and I am close to making a decision," she told BBC Sport.

"It's a big decision and I don't want to look back and think, have I made the wrong decision?"
