Marine energy sector off North Wales coast can be unleashed with £12m cash boost
The marine energy sector received a major boost today with £12m pumped into a project to exploit potential opportunities off the North Wales coast.

Bangor University’s £17m SEACAMS 2 project, which aims to expand Wales’ marine energy sector over the next four years, has received the cash.

Experts at Bangor and Swansea universities will provide specialist research and development programmes to help businesses exploit commercial opportunities and create new products and patents.

The project hopes to create new enterprises in the sector and accelerate job creation in existing businesses.

It follows the initial SEACAMS project, which helped to secure investment by Swedish company Minesto in a £25m giant underwater kite project off Anglesey.

Professor Colin Jago, director of the SEACAMS project, said: “We will build on our five years of work with industry during the first SEACAMS funding phase.

“In pooling expertise at Bangor and Swansea universities, we have the scope of knowledge to provide the detailed technical information required to support these exciting developments, which could change the way we resource our energy needs in Wales.”

A further £4.8m of Welsh Government money will support Conwy Council’s OPUS project to improve the personal skills and employability of long-term unemployed and economically inactive people aged 25 and over across North Wales over the next three years.

Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said: “This is a major investment of EU funding which will finance highly specialised-innovation in an important sector of our economy and target support to people who are finding it difficult to get into work.

“These projects are also good examples of how EU funds are being used in Wales to grow businesses, improve people’s lives and strengthen our economy.”
