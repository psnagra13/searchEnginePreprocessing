SAARC Summit May Be Postponed, Hints Pakistan
PM Narendra Modi will not travel to Pakistan to attend the SAARC summit in November.

New Delhi: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled out of the regional SAARC summit in Islamabad in the aftermath of the terror attack in Uri, leading to its boycott by three other nations, Pakistan hinted that the session, due in November, may be postponed. Nepal, which is chairing the summit, said it strongly urged the creation of a "conducive environment" that will ensure the participation of all.
