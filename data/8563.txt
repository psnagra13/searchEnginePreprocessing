Paedophile offended again ... after getting job at family tourist attraction
Jamie Campbell, a convicted child sex offender, was working at Llandudno Pier when he offended again

A convicted paedophile ended up being given a job at one of North Wales’ most popular family tourist attractions.

Jamie Campbell had been given four years in jail in 2010 and was registered as a sex offender.

But when he was released he managed to get a job as a supervisor at Llandudno Pier.

He there met a girl of 13, who he sent social media message to asking if she could keep a secret, asking her if she wanted to see a “naughty” picture.

He had also tried to get a photograph of another youngster’s backside, and sent her an image of his groin.

At Llandudno magistrates court yesterday, prosecutor James Neary said: “Police have seized all devices capable of accessing the internet from his home, including his mobile phone, and they will be scrutinised.

“The investigation is now at its early stages.”

Campbell, 31, of Pen Lan, Towyn, was remanded in custody until sentencing next month after pleading guilty to two counts of persuading young girls to put his details on their phones and send sexual messages on Snapchat.

Defence solicitor Richard Williams said :”Mr Campbell is realistic about his position.” There was no application for bail.

Campbell was jailed in 2010 after admitting sexual activity with a child when working at an amusement arcade.

He was caught after a teacher at the girl’s school noticed she was upset and the girl revealed the relationship with Campbell.

The judge in the case said Campbell had “taken the opportunity to seduce that young girl and vent your sexual appetite upon her.”
