Then and now: Deepika Padukone as a school girl
Poets and lyricists have gone out of their way to define Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's beauty with their words. However, the gorgeous Miss World winner still manages to stun each time she makes an appearance - be it in a film or in public. So, when she romanced Ranbir Kapoor in the 'Bulleya' song from 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' the world stopped and took notice. While Aish looked marvellous in every shot, the one of her wearing a red top with a black jacket roused memories of a similar outfit in the 2000 film, 'Josh.' In a side-by-side comparison of the two looks, it is harder to find any difference. It is as if Aishwarya hasn't aged over the years. She indeed is a timeless beauty!
