Govt launches "Progress Panchayat" to reach out to minorities
MEWAT (HARYANA): On a day when Indian Army conducted a military strike in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) in retaliation to the terror attack in Uri, minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi launched " Progress Panchayat ," the government's Muslim outreach programme for development and empowerment of the minority community, from the Mewat region of Haryana which has a large Muslim population. He called out to the community to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's offensive against Pakistan as it was a reply to the terror attack in Uri and other such attacks from across the border."Prime Minister Modi works 24 hours for development and security of the people of this country. When there is any threat to our security he stands shoulder to shoulder with every countryman in defence. Do you feel there should be befitting reply to those forces that are against the lives in a nation of 1.25 billion Hindu and Muslim people. If you do raise your hands to show you stand with PM Modi." And, the crowds raised their hands in assertion, cheering for Modi.Seeking to "remove any misconceptions" among Muslims at the first 'Progress Panchayat' Naqvi hit out at "so- called political champions of secularism" who he said are only engaged in exploitation of minorities The launch of the outreach programme from this Muslim- dominated area comes days after Modi said that Muslims should be treated as "own" and should be empowered. "We have come to hold dialogue with people as per Modiji's instructions. Earlier the outreach was limited to electioneering but ministers will reach out to people even after elections and this is the prime example," Naqvi said."Our steadfast concern remains development and we will not deviate from that agenda," the Union minister said.He said the objective of the 'Progress Panchayat' was not political but to reach out to the minority community and apprise them of the development initiatives taken by the government.Naqvi assured the crowds that the NDA government was against votebank politics and was only committed to empower and provide equal opportunities.Union Minister and local MP Krishan Pal Gurjar was also present at the event.Another Progress Panchayat was held in Palwal which was attended by local MP and Union Minister Rao Inderjit Singh.Both the districts where the programme was held have a sizable Muslim population. Mewat had witnessed tension following the murder of a couple and gangrape of two members of the family allegedly by a cow protection group last month.Sarpanchs of nearby villages raised the issue of brackish water, education and power.Naqvi will take part in a similar programme at Tijara in Rajasthan's Alwar district on October 3 and is expected to attend a total of 100 such panchayats across the country in areas which have a significant presence of minorities.
