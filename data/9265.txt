army surgical strikes: India has every right to hit out at Pakistan: Bangladesh
NEW DELHI: Bangladesh was the first neighbouring country to accept that India had "all legal and globally accepted right" to respond to any attack on her sovereignty, even as the United Nations urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint after the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes at terror launch pads along the LoC.Iqbal Chowdhury, adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , too called for "restraint" and said, "It (Kashmir issue) has been a long, continued dispute and there has been a... violation from the other side and Bangladesh always believes that any aggression or attack on the sovereignty of the independence and legal right of a country is not acceptable and Bangladesh always feels that any country must honour and respect the sovereignty of a third country".He went on to add, "Bangladesh always feels that in these type of things, there should be restraint from all sides because we believe that in the Saarc countries, we need to live in a peaceful environment, honouring the sovereign rights of each member country," he added.Meanwhile, the United Nations on Thursday encouraged India and Pakistan to resolve differences through dialogue. "The United Nations calls on the government of India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and encourage them to continue their efforts to resolve their differences peacefully and through dialogue," UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.Pakistan said two of its soldiers had been killed and nine wounded in what it described as small arms fire and dismissed the talk of surgical strikes as an "illusion" designed to whip up "media hype".Dujarric said UN officials were following the increase in tensions in Kashmir "with great concern" and that UN military observers were in contact with both sides to obtain further information.
