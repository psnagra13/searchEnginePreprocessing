A profit warning from Capita, the company which operates the London congestion charge amongst other things, has prompted its shares to plunge 20%.

The outsourcing firm said this year's pre-tax profit would be between £535m and £555m, down from a previous estimate of £614m.

It blamed a slowdown in trading in some businesses and one-off costs from the congestion charge contract.

"Continued delays in client decision making" also contributed, it said.

Shares in Capita were down 24% at 724p in the first hour of trade.

The company said it was taking immediate steps to reduce costs in its underperforming businesses.

Capita employs 75,000 in the UK, Europe, India and South Africa.
