PM Modi Chairs Meet On Line Of Control, Big Announcement Likely
Prime Minister Narendra Modi this morning called an urgent meeting of the country's top ministers to review security after Pakistan violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, days after an army camp in Uri was attacked, leaving 18 soldiers dead.The Cabinet Committee on Security which includes the Defence, Home and Foreign Ministers is to be followed by a briefing that includes representatives of the Defense Ministry. Sources said a significant announcement related to the Line of Control is likely, possibly explaining India's response to cross-border firing by Pakistani troops.PM Modi postponed another meeting to next week that was to look at possibly downgrading Pakistan's status as a trading partner.Today's security meeting was attended also by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. The Defence Ministry's inclusion in the press briefing that is expected soon is both unusual and significant as so far, the government has indicated that its campaign against Pakistan will largely be centred around diplomatically isolating it.In line with that strategy, the Prime Minister said he will not travel in November to Pakistan to attend the regional SAARC summit. Three other countries of the 8-member SAARC have joined India's boycott.
