Ben Emmerson QC, the most senior lawyer working for the independent inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in England and Wales, has resigned.

Inquiry chairwoman Prof Alexis Jay denied it was down to a difference of opinion with her, saying Mr Emmerson believed it is time for "someone else to take the role forward".

Mr Emmerson was suspended on Wednesday due to "concerns about his leadership".

Prime Minister Theresa May has said she still has confidence in the inquiry.

Mr Emmerson's resignation comes just hours after it was revealed his colleague Elizabeth Prochaska - the inquiry's second most senior lawyer - had also stepped down.

Doubts over role

In his resignation letter to Prof Jay, posted on the inquiry's website, Mr Emmerson said he was "sad" to leave the inquiry after two years.

However, Mr Emmerson said he had doubts about whether he was the right person for the inquiry when he was re-appointed to the role by Prof Jay in September last year.

He wrote: "Since then, it has become clear to me that I am not the person to take this review forward on your behalf.

"It is now time for someone else to take the helm with a different leadership of the counsel team.

"There is no truth in suggestions that I have resigned due to a difference of opinion with you about the next steps for the inquiry."

Prof Jay said Mr Emmerson will "continue to be available to the inquiry whilst his replacement is recruited and brought up to speed."

Ms Prochaska's resignation as first junior counsel on 15 September is said to be unrelated to other events.
