India Conducts Surgical Strikes Across Line Of Control, Takes Out Pak Terrorists
The army has carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent Pakistani terrorists who had "positioned themselves at launch pads with the aim to carry out strikes in Jammu and Kashmir and other metros," said the army today. India revealed the strikes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the cabinet committee on security. He had pledged that this month's attack by Pakistani terrorists on an army base in Uri in Kashmir will be punished.
