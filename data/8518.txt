LG V20 Goes on Sale This Week; US Pre-Orders Expected to Start October 17
LG at its September 7 event launched the first new smartphone to run Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box - the LG V20 - with dual screen and dual cameras. The price and availability details were not given by the company then. Now the company has officially confirmed that LG V20 is going to be available starting this week. The smartphone will make its public debut in LG's home country, South Korea, followed by other regions like North America, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East over the course of the next several weeks. Pricing and availability for each region will be announced at the time of the local launch.

In addition to that, US e-commerce website B&H has listed the unlocked version of LG V20 for pre-orders starting October 17. However, it has not specified the price and availability of the smartphone in the US on its website. However, according to The Korea Times, LG V20 is reported to be priced at an equivalent of $804 (roughly Rs. 53,000) in its home market South Korea, where it is also launching first.

To recall, the LG V20 is an attempt from the company to revive the sales, as its flagship - the modular LG G5 smartphone - failed to do well in the market. It comes with a 5.7-inch main IPS Quantum Display and also a secondary display, such as was seen on the LG V10. The secondary display comes with a font size that's 50 percent larger than that of V10.

The LG V20 packs a quad-core Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 820 CPU, with two cores clocked at 2.15GHz and the other two running at 1.6GHz. It has 32GB and 64GB inbuilt storage options, with a support to expand via microSD card (up to 256GB). It also packs a 3200mAh battery. There is a dual rear camera setup in the smartphone, with a 135-degree 8-megapixel lens accompanied by 16-megapixel 75-degree lens, apart from a 5-megapixel 120-degree lens shooter on the front.

The V20 comes with features like 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, HD Audio Recorder, and B&O Play speakers. It houses a bottom-mounted USB Type-C port and it will be available Titan, Silver, and Pink colour variants. In the meanwhile, LG India's Managing Director, Kim Ki-Wan, confirmed to Gadgets 360 that the company plans to bring the LG V20 smartphone to India soon.
