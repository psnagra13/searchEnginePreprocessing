To recall, Apple partnered with Flipkart earlier this month to expand the online availability of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones in India. Until recently, Apple had Infibeam as its only authorised online reseller. Apple's tie-up with Flipkart means the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available at the official launch price at the online retailer. The biggest advantage for Flipkart with the partnership will be that it can source the new iPhone models from Apple directly, instead of Apple partners. Those units still carried Apple warranty, so for end users this is unlikely to be a big change.

The new iPhone 7 series sports a refreshed design and the rear antenna bands have been redesigned to make them less prominent than before. Both the phones feature a brand new home button that uses Taptic vibrations to simulate a physical tap. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus also come with IP67 water and dust resistance.
