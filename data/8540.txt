Omagh bombing: European court dismisses real IRA men's claim
The European Court of Human Rights has dismissed a claim by men found liable for the Omagh bomb that the civil court action against them was unfair.

In June 2009, Liam Campbell was found liable, along with Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, for the atrocity.

It followed a landmark civil action brought by relatives of some of the 29 people killed in the 1998 bombing.

No one has ever been convicted of murder in relation to the County Tyrone car bomb.

Campbell and McKevitt argued that due to the severity of the charges the court should have applied criminal rather than civil standards of proof.

The Omagh bomb was the biggest single atrocity in the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

It happened just four months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed.
