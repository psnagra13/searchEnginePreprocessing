'British people made bad decision on EU'
The Italian prime minister has said it will be "impossible" for Brexit negotiations to result in a deal that gives British people more rights than those outside the EU.

Speaking to the BBC's Katya Adler, Matteo Renzi said the Brexit vote had been "a bad decision" but had to be respected.
