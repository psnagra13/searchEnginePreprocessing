Police helicopter and squad cars chase stolen Porsche across Wrexham
Police cars and the force helicopter chased a stolen Porsche through the streets of Wrexham last night.

Up to four squad cars pursued a black Cayenne 4x4 through Acton which ended up abandoned on Jarvis Way, Acton.

It had been stolen earlier that night from Pant Lane, Gresford, about three and a half miles away.

Four men ran from the scene and are now being hunted by police.

A North Wales Police spokesman said they received a report that a Porsche had been stolen from Pant Lane sometime last night.

Following a pursuit the car was found abandoned in Jarvis Way at around 11.20pm, the police spokesman said.

Det Sgt Paul Kelly said: “I am asking the public to be vigilant especially as the nights draw in. If you see people behaving suspiciously please contact us.”

“I would also remind motorists to keep their keys in a secure place when at home.”

Neighbour Hywel Hughes had just gone to bed when he heard the chase outside finishing at the end of Jarvis Way, which is a cul-de-sac.

The 86 year-old said: “I opened the curtains and looked through the window and saw three to four police cars on the road and I could hear the police helicopter overhead. There was a lot of noise.

“The car, it looked like a big 4x4, had come to a stop by posts at the end of the road and it looked like it had a private number plate.

“I didn’t see anybody else, but later a loader came and took the vehicle away.

“It’s usually a quite place so I was surprised to see the commotion.”

Another neighbour Rachel Christie tweeted: “Porsche 4x4, one tyre destroyed, abandoned in Jarvis Way. No sign of any baddies though.”

There were also reports of a large police presence around Rhosnesni Lane and a loud bang in the area.

Anyone with information about the incident should call police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
