Madhya Pradesh: RSS gives protest call against police action on pracharak
STEPPING UP pressure on the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh to arrest police officials involved in the alleged attack on one of its pracharaks, the RSS has given a call for Balaghat bandh and silent protests across the state on Thursday. Zila pracharak Suresh Yadav, who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Jabalpur, was allegedly attacked on Sunday in Baihar town when the police went to the RSS office to take him into custody following a complaint against him for an anti-Islam post.

State Home Minister Bhupendra Singh announced suspension of ASP Rajesh Sharma, the senior most policeman accused of attack. Singh made the announcement in Gwalior, where the ruling party is holding its two-day executive meet. The attack also figured in the meet because on Tuesday evening party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had tweeted about it, calling the incident as another instance of bureaucracy crossing the line.

Calling it “unpardonable offence”, he alleged that a thana in-charge accompanied by local goondas entered the RSS office and attacked a functionary. The home minister, however, said one incident should not be taken as reflection on the entire bureaucracy.

The Balaghat administration on Wednesday announced a magisterial inquiry into the incident but the RSS was not impressed. “It’s a strategy to buy more time. We want the policemen arrested immediately,’’ RSS leader Prashant Pol told The Indian Express. IG (Balaghat Range) D C Sagar said no arrests had been made so far and that teams were looking for the accused police officials.

A letter written on behalf of the policemen went viral on Wednesday. The unsigned letter questioned the action against policemen arguing that the accused police officials were carrying out their duty.
