Following the joint press conference by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, where DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said that India conducted surgical strikes Wednesday night along the LoC, the government has called for an all-party meeting on Thursday. Pakistan troops had on Wednesday reportedly targeted Indian positions with small firearms along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.

Following the meeting of Cabinet Committee on Security, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh had announced that India had responded to the repeated infiltration along the LoC.

“Significant casualties have been caused to terrorists and those trying to shield them. We don’t have a plan to further conduct such strikes. India has spoken to Pakistan,” DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said. “… Now, based on very specific and credible information we received yesterday, that some terrorist teams had positioned themeselves at launch pads along the LoC with an aim to carry out infiltration and terrorist strikes in J&K and various other metros in our country. There were launch pads at the LoC where terrorists were present waiting to infiltrate the nation and attack areas in Kashmir and metros across the country,” the DGMO said.

Pakistan has confirmed the death of two of its soldiers in cross-border firing but denies that India conducted any surgical strikes. No casualties were reported by the Indian Army, sources said.
