Surgical strikes across LoC: Government braces for Pakistan retaliation, ups vigil
NEW DELHI: As the security establishment watches out for Islamabad's response to the surgical strikes, border vigil has been tightened and surveillance stepped up to track terrorists who have already crossed over into Jammu and Kashmir with plans to escalate violence in the coming days.Sources in the intelligence agencies told TOI that Pakistan appears to be still weighing all scenarios, keeping the local constituency as well as international repercussions in mind, before it comes up with a formal response to the surgical strikes. While a verbal response or statement is expected by Friday, retaliatory action on the ground may not happen right away. "Just like Indian forces took time to prepare for the strikes, Pakistan army will need time to plan and execute a retaliatory response," said an officer.The surgical strikes clearly caught Pakistani agencies unawares. "They never apprehended that India would revise its strategy against infiltration and cross the LoC to hit terror bases and launch pads in PoK," claimed an intelligence officer.Given the spike in infiltration over the past few months that has seen nearly 100 terrorists cross over from Pakistan, agencies fear that any armed retaliation by the neighbour to the surgical strikes will only add to the threat of suicide attacks against security forces in J&K.Intelligence sources said an alert has been sounded across the Valley, which has witnessed a long spell of un-rest following the death of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani on July 8. "Police stations across the Valley have been alerted and movements of terrorists are being tracked in real time," said an officer.Fearing an escalation in hostilities along the international border, the BSF has al-ready stepped up alert in the border states of J&K, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Residents of villages close to the border in Jammu & Punjab are being evacuated as a precautionary measure against escalated firing and shelling by Pakistani forces.Sources said there was no reaction so far in the Valley to the Army's surgical operation. "People are still waiting to see how Pakistan reacts," an intelligence officer said.Though intelligence agencies foresee an escalation in violence in J&K, both along the border and in the hinterland, a top official said there was no discernible threat of a terror attack in the rest of the country coinciding with the ensu-ing festive season.Launch pads are tempora-ry/makeshift accommodation used by terrorists who have completed their three-level terror training. Terrorists come to the launchpads after completing the Daura-e-Khaas at training camps in PoK and may stay there for a few days, waiting for the right opportunity to sneak into Indian territory.
