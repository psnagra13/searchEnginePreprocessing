Tribune News Service

Srinagar, September 28

Strict restrictions were imposed in some Kashmir areas as the police foiled a separatist-called march, leading to clashes between protesters and police personnel today, while restrictions and shutdown continued across the Valley. The police foiled protest rallies called by separatist organisations in Bandipora, Ganderbal, Budgam and Kulgam districts, which led to clashes. The clashes took place at Koimoh in Kulgam district of south Kashmir and Hajin in Bandipora district of north Kashmir. The police imposed strict restrictions in some areas of the central Kashmir district of Ganderbal to foil the separatist-called march to Wakura. The restrictions were imposed in the Khag area of Budgam district in central Kashmir. Normal life continued to remain paralysed across Kashmir for the 82nd day following the July 8 killing of militant commander Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces. The curfew, restrictions and shutdowns had crippled normal life with all shops and business establishments closed and public transport off the roads. At least 85 persons, including two policemen, had died and over 12,000 injured in clashes so far.
