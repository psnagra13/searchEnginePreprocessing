Congratulating the Indian Army on the surgical attacks conducted on terrorist camps along the Line of Control on Thursday, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that “the real message has been sent to Pakistan”.

“I am very proud of the Indian Army, the real message has been sent to Pakistan. Well done,” ANI quoted Shashi Tharoor as saying.

Earlier today, Tharoor had tweeted in support of the Indian Army saying that the NDA government now must ensure the world “understands and stands with us”.

Proud of our Armed Forces for their successful strike against terrorist launch pads. Now Govt must ensure the world understands &stands w/us — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) September 29, 2016

Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, however, condemned the surgical strikes, calling it “naked” and “unprovoked”.

Reacting to Pakistan’s claims, Tharoor said, “What does Pakistan mean by ‘unprovoked’? Killing 18 of our soldiers is not provocation?”

“Whatever Indian Army did was very sensible, measured & proportionate form of retaliation,” added Tharoor.

Earlier in the day, DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, in a joint press conference of the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Defence, said that India had conducted surgical strikes along the Line of Control. The surgical strikes came after Pakistan troop had reportedly targetted Indian positions along the LoC on Wednesday.

Tension between the two nations has increased after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in a terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. The attacks at the army camp was carried out by Pakistan-based terror outfits.
