Pro-Pak slogans appear on hacked Odisha agriculture board site
The official website of Odisha State Agricultural Marketing (OSAM) Board was on Thursday hacked with Pro-Pakistan and Free Kashmir slogans written on its welcome page.

Though it is not clear if any other information was hacked, the website was defaced by a group called “Silent Lov3R”. There was no reaction from the OSAM Board about the hacking.

OSAM is the regulatory body for the agricultural marketing structure in the state and looks after regulated market committees. The cooperation minister is the ex-officio chairman of the board.

This is the third time official websites of Odisha have been hacked by groups who left Pro-Pak slogans on the webpage.
