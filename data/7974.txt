Hamirpur, September 28

To check illegal mining, the geological wing of the state today closed 21 roads leading to the Beas and other rivulets. Taking cognisance of a report published in these columns on September 21, the High Court had ordered the government to intervene in the matter. A geologist, HC Sanjeev Sharma, has been in the area for the last two days. He met mining officials of Hamirpur and Kangra and discussed ways to stop the illegal practice. A JCB machine was pressed into service to dig up the roads leading to the Beas near Nadaun and rivulets Maan Khud and Kunah Khud. The district has 18 mining blocks and only five could be auctioned. Of these, only two could get environmental clearance. Sanjeev Sharma said 21 access roads to the rivers and rivulets had been closed. He said the mining officer had been told to submit a report on mining before October 1.
