Shimla, September 28

The Himachal Pradesh High Court today expressed displeasure over the irregular water supply in Shimla. It sought explanation from the Municipal Corporation (MC) as to why there was shortage of water supply in the city again. While passing the direction, a division Bench comprising of Chief Justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, further directed the MC to ensure water supply in the city as per the directions passed by the court from time to time. The HC also directed the civic body to file a status report in this regard on or before October 25. The court passed the orders on a petition taken up suo moto as Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on news items published in the media in January 2016 regarding contaminated water being supplied in the city. The reports even suggested that sewage-mixed water was being supplied to the residents and had created an epidemic-like situation in Shimla. During the hearing of the petition, the Pollution Control Board brought to the notice of the court that the MC Shimla had given detail of 42 water storage tanks and four reservoirs from where the Board had taken samples. Out of these, 12 reports had been received and others were awaited. The court also directed the Pollution Control Board to file a status report on the next date of hearing of the case.
