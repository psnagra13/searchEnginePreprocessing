Ex-servicemen to resume stir
Chandigarh, September 28

Ex-servicemen have decided to resume their agitation and fast at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in protest against the government failing to resolve perceived anomalies in the implementation of “one rank-one pension” (OROP) formula. A statement issued by the Indian Ex-services Movement today said the protest would commence from October 2 in Delhi as well as at other places. — TNS
