Troubled by the subcontinent conditions, the spin-wary New Zealanders on Thursday took tips from former India captain Sourav Ganguly who gladly offered his know-how, demonstrating a few drives near the centre wicket on the eve of the second Test.

The Cricket Association of Bengal chief was seen having a friendly chat with New Zealand batting coach Craig McMillan and another support staff who were paying a lot of attention to the former lefthander.

Ganguly quickly got into his lefthanded stance and gave suggestions to play strokes through the V, and how the ball moves in these conditions.

The Eden strip has been in the news after it was reported that it would lack spin as the grass was further trimmed on Thursday morning.

“The ball is likely to move in the first two days and there should be turn from day three. We have got Bermuda grass that makes the wicket harder as the ball travels faster. The best part is it grows quicker and takes away the moisture,” Ganguly, who was seen checking the firmness of the pitch with a key, said.
