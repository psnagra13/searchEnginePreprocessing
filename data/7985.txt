President Pranab Mukherjee today paid obeisance at the Kedarnath shrine on the second day of his three-day visit to Uttarakhand. He, along with his son Abhijit Mukherjee, took part in the prayers. He was accompanied by Governor KK Paul and Chief Minister Harish Rawat. Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee chairperson Ganesh Godiyal and other officials welcomed the President in a traditional way at the Kedarnath helipad. Garhwal Commissioner Vinod Sharma, IG Sanjay Gunjyal, Rudraparyag District Magistrate Raghav Langer received the President and other dignitaries. The President also took stock of the reconstruction work carried out at Kedarnath which bore the brunt of the June 2013 calamity. It was the President’s first visit to the centuries-old shrine after assuming office. Two of his proposed visits to the temple in the past were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. Later, Chief Minister Harish Rawat informed the President about the reconstruction projects being conducted in the region. He disclosed various facilities being provided to the devotees. “Pilgrims from across the world have appreciated the efforts taken by the government. More than 12 lakh devotees completed the Char Dham and Hemkund Sahib yatras this year,” the Chief Minister told the President. The President’s three-day schedule will conclude tomorrow after he witnesses the Ganga Aarti on the banks of the Ganga at Har-ki-Pauri in Haridwar.
