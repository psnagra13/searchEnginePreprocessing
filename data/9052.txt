Higher fines were imposed for doing the same near temples, the royal palace or a water reservoir.In the first elaborate story on the traditions of cleanliness in the country, story-telling 'uncle Anant' narrates to kids how in Vedas, the relation between diseases and poor hygiene was highlighted and Manusmriti prescribed the need for a clean body for a clean mind and clean community.

But Modi ji knew how to make the impossible possible. With increasing participation of people, India will become clean."
