Meeting called by PM to review Pakistan's MFN status postponed to next week
NEW DELHI: The meeting to be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to review Pakistan;s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status, has been postponed to next week, ANI reported.The decision to review the MFN status had come in the wake of the Uri attack, after which India has been weighing various options to respond and isolate Islamabad.Among others, officials from commerce and external affairs ministries are expected to attend the meeting next week. According to sources, the meeting's attendees may deliberate upon the option of dragging Pakistan to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism for not according similar status to India.Under MFN, a WTO member country is obliged to treat other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies.India granted the MFN status to Pakistan in 1996 but Pakistan is yet to reciprocate to that. The neighbouring country has missed its own deadline of December 2012 for this. As per the WTO rules, India can roll back the MFN status from Pakistan.According to experts, withdrawal of the MFN status by India is likely to hurt Pakistani industries as it might stop flow of raw materials at competitive prices.In 2015-16, India's exports to Pakistan stood at $2.17 billion, while imports were $441 million.This meeting comes after the Prime Minister chaired a review meeting of 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty during which it was decided that India will "exploit to the maximum" the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per the water sharing pact.
