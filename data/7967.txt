Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a yoga training session for teachers of government schools, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in a dig at the Delhi Police today said "lodging FIRs is their dharma", but the government will continue doing its job. The attack was made in the context of police cases lodged against Aam Aadmi Party MLAs with various charges. At least 15 AAP legislators have been charged under various sections by the Delhi Police. In view of this, Kejriwal and his party has been crying "political vendetta" claiming the actions are being taken at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. To a question on several AAP MLAs being booked in different cases, Sisodia said, "Lodging FIRs is their dharma, but we will keep doing our job ('FIR karna unka dharm hai, hum apna kaam karte rahenge')". Meanwhile, the yoga session was held in partnership with yoga guru Ramdev's Patanjali Yogpeeth. On the occasion, Ramdev praised the initiative taken by the government saying other state governments should take inspiration from it. On similar lines, Sisodia said, "I hope other state governments would understand the importance of yoga in children's lifestyle and take inspiration. Sixteen lakh students in government schools will now have access to quality yoga education." "Yoga is a scientific way of physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual growth. It is a secular lifestyle and channels the internal energy," Ramdev said. He thanked Kejriwal for the training session on yoga for the teachers.
