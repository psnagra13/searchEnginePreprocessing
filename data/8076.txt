Slithery Visitor Sparks Panic At A Gas Station Near Agra Agra
We are all familiar with long, snaking lines at fuel pumps, but imagine if a long snake turned up instead.That's exactly what happened on the busy Delhi-Agra expressway today at a CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) station in Runakta near Agra on Wednesday.Workers at the station heard a rustling noise coming from bushes near the station. When they went to examine the source, they were shocked to see a 13-foot Python hiding in the foliage."The staff members were shocked and terrified by the unexpected sight of the gigantic reptile and immediately reported the incident to us," said Varun Kumar, the manager of the station.Mr Kumar then called up Wildlife SOS, a non-profit that rescues animals in distress. The team arrived within half an hour to discover the snake hiding in the bushes with several deep bruises on its skin and below its jaw."The python was in immense pain and had deep cuts just below its jaw. We believe that the injuries were caused by the sharp barbed wires along the boundary," said Dr MV Sharma, Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS.It took the team over 30 minutes to safely remove the snake weighing over 24 kg. The Rock Python, found in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka is not poisonous and is found in the region."We were fortunate that the workers called us up when they did and we were able to rescue it," said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder Wildlife SOS.The slithery customer is currently at the organisation's shelter in Agra and will be released back in its habitat once it recovers.
