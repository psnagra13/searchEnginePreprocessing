England football coach Allardyce sacked Sam Allardyce was sacked as England manager on Tuesday having behaved "inappropriately" when seeking a lucrative sideline role while talking to undercover reporters, bringing a crushing end to his dream job after one match and 67 days in charge. The undercover sting was set up by Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper.
