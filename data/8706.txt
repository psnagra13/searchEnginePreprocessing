What to Expect From Google's October 4 Event
This week on Orbital we talk all things Google. Android Nougat may not have reached all Nexus device owners but if rumours are to be believed such issues will not plague the upcoming Pixel smartphones. Android enthusiasts Ali and Gagan join Pranay to talk about what to expect from Google's October 4 event and whether we'd be talking about those announcements eight years from now.

But before we get into that, we discuss all of Google's India-centric announcements starting with Google Station. Will the move towards offering free Wi-Fi benefit Google in any way? We come up with some interesting theories. We also talk about YouTube Go and all of the benefits it has in store for Indians. The discussion moves the Google Allo's Hindi Assistant before we wonder whether the service will be able to take on WhatsApp in India. We also talk about all the improvements to Google Play and how it'll help many of us who deal with slow Internet speeds and can't afford expensive cellular data packs.

Somewhere along the way we decide to temper our excitement for all of these upcoming features and move on to talking about all that's expected from Google's event on October 4, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones.
