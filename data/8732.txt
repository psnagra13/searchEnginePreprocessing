Telangana Government Inflating Costs Of Public Projects
Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has accused the Telangana government of inflating the cost of various public projects by many times and also of not allocating funds to panchayats."The Telangana government has increased the value of each project by 100 to 200 times. They are taking everyone for a ride and not fulfilling their election promises," Mr Singh said.Mr Singh, in-charge of the Congress in Telangana, also said he was "really amused" when Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao during his recent visit to the state."The Mr Amit Shah (BJP president) comes and says it (Telangana) is one of the most corrupt governments in India. So either Mr Modi is fooling the people, or Amit Shah is fooling the people and Mr Rao is fooling both of them," Mr Singh said."It is for the people of Telangana to understand who is correct. Whether Mr Modi is correct, or Mr is correct, or Amit Shah is correct. The Congress feels that all three are fooling the people of Telangana. Mr Modi fooled the people of the country by making election promises claiming to put Rs 15 lakh in every bank account by bringing aback all the black money," Mr Singh added.The Congress is prepared to "take on" Mr Rao and also "expose him in the minds of the people because of the false promises he has made," he said, and alleged that the state government has not given any funds, power and authority to panchayats.
