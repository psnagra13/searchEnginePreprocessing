The district police have arrested two more members of the gang involved in the sex racket unearthed yesterday. While Jind-based man Shamsher and his wife Rekha were arrested yesterday, Saroj and Rajbir of Hisar district were arrested from Lakhanmajra in Rohtak district late in the night. Rohtak SSP Rakesh Arya maintained that a special team led by Dr Ravinder had been constituted. Following that, raiding parties were despatched to nab other members of the gang whose names had cropped up during the investigation. Interrogation of the arrested persons revealed that the gang comprised Rekha and her husband Shamsher of Kalouda (Jind), Saroj, wife of Jaipal, and Rajbir of Kapdo (Hisar), Saroj of Jind, another Saroj of Fatehabad, Kavita and another person. Saroj of Fatehabad has reportedly involved her two daughters in the racket. The women members of the gang used to entice unsuspecting men to have sex with them. Following that, they blackmailed them by threatening to lodge police complaints for raping them. They even lodged FIRs to put pressure on the men and used to withdraw their complaint after extorting hefty amounts. The matter came to light when the wife of one of the victims struck a deal with the gang members and approached the police.
