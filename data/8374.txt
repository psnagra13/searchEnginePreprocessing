Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he would continue fighting against the RSS and organisations that share ‘that ideology’ claiming they were trying to ‘divide the nation’.

Speaking to reporters outside a Guwahati court, Rahul said cases were being filed against him because he ‘fights for the rights of poor people and farmers’.

“These cases are being put against me because I’m fighting for poor people, rights of farmers, unemployed youths,” said the Congress party vice-president said in a brief address to the media.

Speaking about the Barpeta Satra incident, Rahul said: “I’ll not be deterred; I’m happy, let them put as many cases as they want, I’ll continue to fight for the unity of this country.”

“I’ll not be deterred; I’m happy, let them put as many cases as they want, I’ll continue to fight for the unity of this country,” Rahul added speaking ahead of his court appearance in the case.
