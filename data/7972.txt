Govt to lift ban on retrofitting of CNG kits
New Delhi, September 28

Delhi Government today said the ban on retrofitting of CNG kits in 'in-use' cars will be revoked soon as the transport department is coming up with a software that will keep records of the sold kits. Members of the Association for CNG kit manufacturers, Distributors and Retro-fitment Centres staged protest outside Delhi Secretariat here demanding immediate revocation of ban on retrofitting of these kits in 'in-use' cars as it has affected their livelihood for the last three months. "Government will revoke its ban on retrofitting of CNG kits (in-use cars) in next few days.," Jain said,â€”PTI
