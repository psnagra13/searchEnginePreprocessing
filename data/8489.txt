Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is to retire after five years as the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, the force has announced.

Sir Bernard, who was appointed to the role in September 2011, will remain in post until February to allow for his successor to be appointed.

During his time in charge, he oversaw policing of the London riots and the Olympic Games.

Sir Bernard said it had been a "great privilege" to serve as commissioner.

"I have loved my time in the role and I have loved being a police officer," he said.

"It's the most rewarding of jobs to protect good people and lock up the bad guys."

According to the Met, crime has fallen by around 18% during the time Sir Bernard has been in post.
