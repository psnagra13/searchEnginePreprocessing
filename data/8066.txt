Mumbai, September 28

Palpreet Singh, the winner of India's first national basketball talent search program, has signed the NBA Development League contract. The 21-year old, a former trainee of the Ludhiana Basketball Academy, will now become eligible for selection in the NBA D League Draft, to be held in October. Singh, who has been training with coach Ross Burn in Manhattan, said: “I am happy with the efforts I have put in and I will continue to work hard and make the most of this opportunity because not many get such a chance." Singh, who had impressed former NBA player and coach Brian Shaw in the national finals of ACG NBA Jump held in February, was part of the national tryouts held on August 14 in New York. Over 200 pro basketball hopefuls exhibited their talents in front of NBA D-League executives, coaches, and industry scouts that day. — PTI
