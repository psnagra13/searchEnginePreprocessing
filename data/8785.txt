If reports are to be believed then Pakistani artists hoping to pursue a career in the Bollywood film industry, are reconsidering their options. The latest addition to that list is actor Ali Zafar's hunky young brother Danyal. According to reports, Danyal was in talks to make his big Bollywood debut in a Karan Johar film starring Fawad Khan and Katrina Kaif. The film that is said to be set in the backdrop of a 'winter wedding' in North India, would have also featured the young lad. However, with the ongoing political tension after the Uri attacks, and the MNS party threatening to 'throw out' Pakistani artists from the country, the fate of this upcoming love story is yet to be decided. The ace Bollywood director is keeping his fingers crossed as his film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' starring Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Pak actor Fawad Khan, nears it release this Diwali.
