US calls up India, condemns Uri attack, offers help on counter-terrorism
The US national security adviser Susan Rice spoke to her Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, and offered greater help from her country on matters of counter-terrorism and designating those behind the Pakistan-based militant groups targeting Indian interest by the United Nations as terrorists.

The call comes in the wake of an ongoing stand-off between India and Pakistan after the attack on an army base in Kashmir’s Uri that killed 18 soldiers.

Rice said it was US expectation that Pakistan take effective action to “combat and delegitimize” United Nations-designated terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, and their affiliates. India blamed Jaish for Uri attack.

“Ambassador Rice strongly condemned the September 18 cross-border attack on the Indian Army Brigade headquarters in Uri and offered condolences to the victims and their families”, a statement from White House said.

Rice also affirmed President Barack Obama’s “commitment to redouble our efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism throughout the world.”

Rice further discussed “shared commitment with India to pursuing peace and regional stability”.

The support from US follows the collapse of the Saarc Summit after India pulled out of it, leading to the conference being called off entirely. Earlier in the month, India tore into Pakistan at the recently concluded 71st United Nations General Assembly, seeking to diplomatically pressure the country.
