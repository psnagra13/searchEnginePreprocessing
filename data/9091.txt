In the wake of the “surgical strikes” by India on terror launch pads across the Line of Control, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today directed the state police to remain alert and take required security measures.

“I have already reviewed the security measures two days back. Today we sensitised and alerted all (Police) Commissioners, Range Inspector Generals of Police and Superintendents of Police to take all measures,” Fadnavis told PTI.

The Chief Minister, who also holds the Home portfolio, was responding to a query about Maharashtra’s security preparedness in the wake of the “surgical strikes”.

Sources in the Mantralaya said the task of carrying out coordination among various security agencies like the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Police and agencies involved in disaster management falls under the Home department.

“So far, the home department has not intimated the departments concerned about any security-related meeting. However, the Chief Minister cancelled his meeting with a Shiv Sena delegation scheduled to be held this evening,” sources said.

The Sena leaders were scheduled to meet Fadnavis to seek a special session over Maratha community’s demand for reservation.

Meanwhile, NCP workers celebrated the Army action by bursting fire crackers and distributing sweets at Worli naka here.
