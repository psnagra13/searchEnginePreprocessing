Surgical strike: Alert in Rajasthan, no evacuation plan
Rajasthan’s BORDER districts have been on alert for three days now but the government has not called for the evacuation of villages, Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said. Following the Army’s strike, Kataria met Thursday evening with police and civil administration officials. “We asked the Army if there was anything that was needed from us, but we were told there is no cause for worry and will be informed if something is required of us,” Kataria said, congratulating the Army for a “successful surgical strike”. He said the alert was sounded three days ago.

Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje “saluted” the Army for the strike, terming it a moonh-tod jawab to Pakistan.
