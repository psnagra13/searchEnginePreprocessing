This could well be the season of combustible smartphones. Even as Samsung’s Note 7 explosions refuse to die down, a customer has posted photos of an new Apple iPhone which was delivered to him in a burnt state. A preliminary look gives the impression that the phone exploded, or caught fire, while in transit. While some reports said it was an iPhone 7 jet black model, the bezel of the device in the photo seems to suggest otherwise. However, it is impossible to make out which make of the iPhone this is. Or if this is a genuine iPhone.

Not much details are available, except for a photo posted by Reddit user “kroopthesnoop”. “Something happened between the factory and delivery,” the post from the disappointed iPhone owner said. The phone was shipped via UPS. Both companies have not commented, while the owner too has not disclosed more details. Interestingly, if this was an explosion, then the iPhone box does not seem to have suffered much damage.

Over the past month, Samsung has been on the hot seat following dozens of reports that its new flagship, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, was prone to fires and explosions due to a faulty lithium ion battery. Even as the company recalled the phones and airlines issues notifications preventing flyers from carrying the Note 7 on board, there were reports that a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 caught fire in a Singapore-Chennai flight.
