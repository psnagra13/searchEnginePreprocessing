Guwahati, September 28

The Congress in Assam has decided to turn vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s tomorrow’s visit to Guwahati for a court appearance into a road show to attack the BJP government in the state and the Centre over spiraling prices, eviction drive near Kaziranga National Park and other issues. A party spokesman said Rahul, who would appear before the court of chief judicial magistrate in connection with a defamation suit filed against him by the RSS, is scheduled to arrive at the airport around 9 am in a private aircraft. He will hold a brief meeting with a group of senior party leaders before appearing at the court in Panbazar at 10 am. The leaders will reportedly brief Rahul on the functioning of the BJP-led government in the state, especially developments in the state in the wake of recent eviction drive in Kaziranga National Park area. “He will be inside the court for around 30 minutes. Then he will hold an impromptu rally on the road junction outside the court before driving to Rajiv Bhavan,” a party spokesman said.
