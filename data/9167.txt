Bollywood celebs and the career they never had
Akshay Kumar: Akshay Kumar aka Khiladi Kumar has impressed everyone with his action chops. But, if his acting career hadn't taken off, Akshay Kumar would have probably been behind the kitchen counter, rustling up a storm. He could have also made a living as a martial arts trainer. Before his big Bollywood break, Akshay reportedly worked as a chef and waiter in Bangkok. Apparently, he was in Thailand to train in martial arts. The actor also has a black belt in Taekwondo. However, to survive in Bangkok, Akshay had to do odd jobs and one of them was working in a restaurant. On his return to India, Akshay reportedly started teaching martial arts and that was when a student noticed him and asked him to try his hands at modelling. And once Akshay took up modelling, it didn't take him long to find his way into Bollywood.
