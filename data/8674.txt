Supreme Court Reserves Verdict In Pleas Challenging Shahabuddin's Bail
The Supreme Court today reserved its verdict in an appeal challenging the grant of bail to controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Shahabuddin in a murder case by Patna High Court.A bench comprising justices PC Ghose and Amitava Roy reserved the order after lawyers representing Shahabuddin and others wrapped up their arguments in the case.Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for Shahabuddin, opposed the appeal challenging the grant of bail and said right to life and liberty should not be curtailed in normal circumstances. He argued that his client was a victim of a media trial and the state government must not play with the liberty of an individual.Yesterday the top court had come down heavily on the Bihar government for not placing all the facts before the Patna High Court, which had granted Shahabuddin bail. The court rebuked the Bihar government and asked "were you in slumber till he got bail?"The counsel for the Nitish Kumar government, which has the RJD as a coalition partner in Bihar, faced searching questions in the apex court which repeatedly questioned its seriousness in pursuing the case against Shahabuddin.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Siwan-based Chandrakeshwar Prasad -- whose three sons have been allegedly murdered at Shahabuddin's behest - appealed in the court that allowing Shahabuddin to be out on bail would amount to a "travesty of justice".
