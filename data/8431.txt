PM Narendra Modi on Thursday presided over a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting on the prevailing tense situation along the Line of Control (LoC). Rajnath Singh, Ajit Doval, Arun Jaitley, S Jaishankar, Manohar Parrikar, Army Chief Dalbir Singh and other senior officials were present at the meeting.

This meeting is significant as the government has launched a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan after the Uri attack, in which 18 soldiers were killed by Jaish-e-Muhammad terrorists. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for the dastardly attack.

Last week, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju had told reporters that any response to the Uri attack would be taken by the government after due consideration. “Action will be taken after due consideration. Action is not taken after making announcements,” he had said. “It is a very serious issue… The matter cannot be handled just like that,” Rijiju added.
