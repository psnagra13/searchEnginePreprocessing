Flipkart will charge the full payment for the pre-booking of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and not a token amount. Officially the iPhone 7 series hits the stores on October 7 in India, and the starting price is Rs 60,000 for the 32GB version.

The full price list looks like this: iPhone 7 with 32GB storage at Rs 60,000, iPhone 7 with 128GB storage at Rs 70,000, iPhone 7 with 256GB storage at Rs 80,000. iPhone 7 Plus with 32GB storage starts at Rs 72,000, iPhone 7 Plus with 128GB storage at Rs 82,000, iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB storage at Rs 92,000.

So what’s new in the iPhone 7 series? For starters, there’s a new black colour option which comes in two finishes: The jet black and matte black. The jet black has this stunning glossy finish and a lot of people want to get their hands on it; call it the Rose Gold of 2016. Except you should know the jet black in iPhone 7 Plus is already sold out in the US and it is prone to scratches quite easily. Even Apple admits you need a case to hide all that beautiful and stunning glossy black.

iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch Retina HD display, but Apple has gone for a wide colour gamut, and according to tests from DisplayMate this LCD display is close to perfection. Apple is using the A10 Fusion quad-core chip on the new iPhones, clocked at 2.23 Ghz. The new chip has two high processing cores and two efficiency cores to ensure better battery life.

The iPhone 7 Plus will get the Portrait mode where you can get DSLR quality ‘bokeh’ shots and also has 2X optical zoom and 10X digital zoom. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now support OIS or optical image stabilisation, which was earlier only on the Plus series.

iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus also come with a redesigned home button with tactile feedback, which takes some time getting used to. Finally, the iPhone 7 series doesn’t have the 3.5 mm headphone jack slot, and instead relies on Lightning powered EarPods. Apple is giving an adapter in the box as well, in case you want to connect your expensive 3.5mm headphones, but remember you can’t charge the device and listen to music at the same time.
