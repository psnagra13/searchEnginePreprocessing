Court raps CBI for shoddy Tytler probe
New Delhi, September 28

A Delhi court today pulled up the CBI for conducting a shoddy probe into allegations against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma, directed CBI’s SP to be present in the court on the next date of hearing on October 25. He passed the order after perusing the status report submitted by the CBI. Appearing for complainant Lakhwinder Kaur, advocate HS Phoolka brought to the notice of the court the order dated December 4, 2015. In it, the court had rejected the third clean chit given to Tytler and told the CBI the lines on which the probe should be conducted. The court today asked the CBI about the investigation regarding witness Narinder Singh whose contact details were shared by the counsel for complainant. The CBI said there was no response on the phone number shared by the complainant’s counsel. Phoolka said the number shared by them as functional and also that as Narinder Singh’s relatives were in Delhi and Punjab, they could have made efforts to trace them. The court asked the CBI about the information from the Canadian Government. The CBI said they approached the Canadian Government and showed the communication letter. The court said the letter was undated and this showed that effective steps were not being taken. — TNS
