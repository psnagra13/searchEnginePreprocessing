Scarlett Keeling's Mother Writes To Prime Minister, Wants Fresh Investigation
British teenager Scarlett Keeling's mother, Fiona MacKeown has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting his intervention in the case of death of her daughter in Goa and has sought a fresh investigation by a Special Investigation Team."The local fishermen informed me (then that) she was murdered by a drug mafia in Goa, but as this drug mafia had strong connections with local police and politicians, it would be pointless for me to approach the criminal justice system," Ms MacKeown said in the letter to the Prime Minister, which she made public today.Goa Children's court had last week acquitted two men who were charged with drugging and leaving Scarlett to die on Anjuna beach on February 18, 2008."Up to now, I refused to believe that the local fishermen were right, and placed my trust in the system," Ms MacKeown said. She also said that she needs to know who 'killed' her daughter, if the two accused are not guilty. She demanded that the people responsible for the 'murder' of her daughter be identified and prosecuted."Those who destroyed the evidence were never charged. Those authorities, who shielded the criminals by providing them enough time to destroy the evidence, were never charged," she said.Scarlett was found dead on the famous Anjuna beach of Goa on February 18, 2008.Initially, Goa Police and later the CBI probed the case, which attracted international attention, besides raising questions on the safety of women in Goa.Two men -- Samson D'Souza and Placido Carvalho -- were accused by CBI in the case. The two were accused of leaving the girl to die on the beach after drugging and sexually abusing her.Last Friday, the court had acquitted them of all the charges leading to reactions of shock and disappointment from Scarlett's family and politicos in Goa. The court had also raised serious doubts about the impartiality of the probe in the case.
