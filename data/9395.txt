BEIJING A court in southwestern China on Friday jailed for life the former Communist Party boss of the southern city of Guangzhou after finding him guilty of corruption.

The Nanning court said on its official microblog that it had also ordered all of Wan Qingliang's assets to be seized.

Wan was put under investigation in 2014.
