Cong wants SAARC meet, minus Pak
Tribune News Service

New Delhi, September 28

The Congress today criticised India’s decision to boycott the upcoming SAARC summit in Islamabad, saying India should have worked for convening the summit anywhere in South Asia minus Pakistan. “South Asia is the least integrated region in the world. It faces unique challenges of poverty and human development. Is scrapping SAARC summit the answer? The government should have explored the possibility of holding the summit somewhere in South Asia minus Pakistan,” Congress’ Manish Tewari said a day after the government announced India would not participate in the November summit in Pakistan. The Congress cited SAARC history to argue that summits have not followed a pattern and have been randomly hosted by partner nations. It said India could demand amendments to the SAARC charter which does not allow possibilities of change of venue once finalised. It said the government's responses indicate that the PM’s Pakistan policy is swinging between the "sublime and the ridiculous".
