Senior advocate K T S Tulsi on Thursday stated that the proposed move to withdraw the status of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) from Pakistan would be very unfortunate and urged the government to have a rethink over it. “This is an unfortunate development, but then what else can one do. These Most Favored Nation treatment came about after ten years of hard work of the previous government and the Centre must think again, after all, they are going to remain our neighbour, we need to have a working arrangement with them,” Tulsi told ANI.

Tulsi further said the government should think of the long term consequences before demolishing all confidence-building measures with Islamabad.

While supporting the government’s decision of boycotting the 19th SAARC Summit being organised by Pakistan in November, Tulsi said, “In the current atmosphere, it is not possible to have any talks about development or anything. I think the decision to boycott the SAARC summit in the present circumstances is perhaps the only option.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a review meeting today over the status of ‘Most Favoured Nation’ granted to Pakistan. It is expected that officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and Commerce Ministry would attend the meeting.

Meanwhile, speculations are on a high that India is considering withdrawal of the MFN status to Pakistan in the wake of the Uri terror attack, in which 18 soldiers were killed, bringing ties between India and Pakistan to an all time low.
