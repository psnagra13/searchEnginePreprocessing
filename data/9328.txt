Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday asked deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of all districts to free encroached government land “without any fear”.

“You must take a proactive step in freeing state lands from encroachers. The people of the state have shown tremendous support to the government in freeing satra and forest lands from encroachers. Officers have to be fearless and must act sternly against any form of encroachment,” Sonowal said, encouraged by the “tremendous support” from the people to the eviction carried out in Kaziranga last week. The BJP-led government had last week evicted encroachers from three villages that had come up on forest and government land, following a Gauhati High Court order that was pending implementation since October last year.
