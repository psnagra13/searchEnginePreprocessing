Jammu and Kashmir State BJP president Sat Sharma also lauded the Prime Minister and the Indian Army for taking the courageous step of destroying terrorist launching pads across the LoC, saying that India has not attacked Pakistan but the terrorists who were waiting to cross into Indian territory. Pointing out that BJP stands with the bereaved families of Uri martyrs, he said that it will provide compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each family of the martyred soldiers hailing from Jammu region.

State Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Dr Nirmal Singh on Thursday applauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Army for carrying out surgical strikes on terrorist launching pads across the Line of Control, saying that this will not only send a very strong message to Pakistan, the perpetrator of terrorism, but also to the separatists and the sympathisers of terrorists.

Speaking at state BJP’s working committee meeting in Udhampur, Singh said that the present government at the Centre was very clear that India will not tolerate any activity which pose threat to its unity and integrity, or cause loss of lives to its soldiers and innocent civilians. Speaking on the evacuation being done in border areas, Singh said, “We have asked people to move to safer places but we will see what happens tonight, we are prepared for any escalation.”
