Virtual ride on new Blackpool Pleasure Beach rollercoaster
A virtual preview of a theme park's new Â£16m rollercoaster has been released.

The 88ft (27m) ride is set to open at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in early 2018,

German firm Mack Rides created a 3D virtual preview of the as-yet-unnamed rollercoaster, which is currently known as Construction 2018.

Deputy managing director Nick Thompson said riders will experience the same level of G force as felt by drivers of Formula 1 cars.
