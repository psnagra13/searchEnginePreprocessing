Wall Street Rallies As OPEC Reaches Output Deal â€“ NDTV Profit
Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday after an OPEC agreement to limit crude output fuelled a rally in oil and more than offset nervousness about a tight race for the U.S. presidency.



The energy index had its best day since January, climbing 4.34 percent after OPEC sources said the group reached a deal to cut its oil production for the first time since 2008. Oil prices rallied as much as 6 percent.



Chevron climbed 3.20 percent and Exxon Mobil gained 4.40 percent. Shares of Caterpillar Inc, which sells heavy equipment to energy companies, jumped 4.48 percent.

Telecom services fell 1.04 percent, the steepest of the decliners.Some investors said that the oil deal would have only a limited ability boost crude prices, which earlier this year hit decade lows."There is still plenty of oil and fossil fuels in general that could come back on. The very fact you do have the U.S. as the marginal producer, it caps the oil price," said Jeff Weniger, senior portfolio strategist at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.Nike dropped 3.78 percent after the shoemaker's orders missed analysts' estimates for the third time in a row.Paychex dropped 4.60 percent after the payroll processor lowered its full-year profit forecast.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favoured advancers.The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 36 new lows.About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, just above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.
