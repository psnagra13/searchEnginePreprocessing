Soon after the announcement by the DGMO of surgical strikes carried out by the Army on terrorist launching pads across the Line of Control, Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to chief ministers of border states, former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and H D Deve Gowda, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, and informed them about the operation.

In a series of tweets later in the day, Rajnath said, “Congratulations to the Indian Army on successful counter terrorism operations against terror groups and their launching pads. We are proud of our armed forces. They have once again exhibited exemplary courage and valour by destroying the anti India designs. I also congratulate Prime Minister Shri @Narendramodi on taking a bold decision and showing true grit and mettle in crucial times.”
