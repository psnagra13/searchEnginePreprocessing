CAT 2016: Registrations record at 7-year high, more female candidates apply
The registrations for the Common Admission Test (CAT) to Indian Institutes of Management and other leading B-schools have shot up to a seven-year high, with 2,32,434 applications received for CAT 2016 as against 2,18,664 registrations for the test last year.

The CAT 2016 registration ended on September 27, 2016. The Indian Institute of Management is conducting the exam this year. “From the period CAT 2010 to CAT 2016, this is the highest number of applicants,” said Professor Rajendra K Bandi, Convenor, CAT 2016, said.

“While we still have a majority of male candidates (67 per cent), the percentage of female candidates has marginally increased by 1 per cent compared to last year, which is a good sign, but not good enough,” he observed.

However, almost half of the around 14,000 additional applications this year had come from women candidates, he said adding that this increase is ‘a positive sign’.

The number of Persons with Disability (PWD) applicants has increased from 901 to 938. “In this category, the percentage of male candidates is very high (more than 80 per cent), which is something to think about.

Our social systems need to encourage female PWD students. However, on the positive side, the percentage of female PWD candidates has increased from 14.76% to 17.48%. Small positive steps, but miles to go on this,” Professor Bandi added.
