Apple is reportedly planning to launch new MacBook Pro notebooks in October. Apple was widely rumoured to launch new Mac lineup at its Special event in September.

With iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series having been announced, the next big product from Apple could be the updated to Mac lineup. Apple’s Mac range has been in need of update for really long time. Apple has also not introduced any flagship device to showcase its new macOS Sierra.

Apple’s new MacBook Pro will reportedly replace the function keys on keyboard with new OLED touch bar. The new OLED touch bar is reported to offer quick access to some of the common actions.

According to MacRumours, Apple will deploy AMD’s ‘Polaris graphics chips’ with the new 15-inch model. Apple is also rumoured to bring Touch ID support to MacBook range. With macOS Sierra, Apple brought support for Apple Pay on web but the feature still relies on using TouchID on iOS device. With Touch ID on Mac, Apple Pay could become a significant experience when it comes to online shopping.

MacRumours reports that Apple is testing macOS 10.12.1 with support for new updated hardware. The new macOS version is aimed to benefit from new features like the OLED bar and native Touch ID support.

Apple is also likely to update MacBook Air models with USB-C port and probably new design. MacBook Air, Apple’s best selling Mac notebook has not seen an update for really long time. Apple is expected to introduce USB-C ports and Intel’s seventh generation chipsets.
