LIVE: BSF calls off Wagah border ceremony after surgical strikes
India carried out ‘surgical strikes’ on terror launch pads across the Line of Control(LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir Wednesday night, inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists and those who are trying to support them.

The announcement of the sudden action by the army was made by the DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh on Thursday, 11 days after the terror strike by Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM on an Indian army camp in Uri in Kashmir over which Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the attackers will not go “unpunished” and that the sacrifice of 18 jawans will not go in vain.

“Based on very credible and specific information which we received yesterday that some terrorist teams had positioned themselves at launch pads along the Line of Control with an aim to carry out infiltration and terrorist strikes in Jammu & Kashmir and in various other metros in our country, the Indian army conducted surgical strikes last night at these launch pads.” Gen Singh told a news conference during which external affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup was also present.
