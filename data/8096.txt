An amount of $5.5 million (Rs 36 crore) was allegedly paid as commission to a middleman based abroad in the Embraer deal, the CBI has found in its probe into allegations of kickbacks in the $208-million aircraft contract. The money was allegedly paid as commission to influence the deal in favour of Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer.
