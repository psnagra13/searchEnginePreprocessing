A cheese shop is opening in Conwy championing Welsh produce.

The Cheese Room Deli, on Rosehill Street, is the brainchild of Ros and Stewart Jones and will be opening next Wednesday, October 5.

The deli will stock produce from local food manufacturers wherever possible but with a focus on cheese including Cosyn Cymru whose award-winning Brefu Bach, from Bethesda, won the best cheese award at the British Cheese Awards.

Other local cheeses will be stocked as well as other Welsh products including Pant Glas Bach, Cryms, Blodyn Aur, Abeffraw Biscuits, Precious Chocolates and others.

Stewart said: “The local area is really buzzing at the moment in the food sector as evidenced by the successes of some of these Welsh companies I have highlighted together with those of the local breweries and gin distilleries and I’m hoping The Cheese Room Deli will go to some way to increasing the momentum in this sector locally.”

Ros added: “We hope to be a great addition to the exceptional selection of independent retailers serving the local community and Conwy’s visitors.”
