Police investigations of three SNP MPs raised at Holyrood
The subject of three SNP MPs being investigated by the police has been raised at Holyrood.

Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser asked Nicola Sturgeon whether the police had adequate resources: "Given the number of the first minister's Westminster colleagues now helping the police with their inquiries, is the first minister confident that Police Scotland has the resources to deal with this upsurge in their workload?"

The first minister responded by saying that the Scottish government had committed to real-terms protection of the police budget.

Police are investigating Dundee West MP Chris Law regarding the Spirit of Independence referendum campaign which he ran ahead of the 2014 vote.

On Tuesday, Glasgow East MP Natalie McGarry was charged in connection with allegations including embezzlement of funds, breach of trust and an offence under the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013.

And there is an ongoing police investigation into property deals said to have involved Edinburgh West MP Michelle Thomson before she was elected to the House of Commons.

Both Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson withdrew from the SNP whip when the allegations were made against them, and have been sitting as independent MPs.
