Jammu, September 28

Legislative Assembly Speaker Kavinder Gupta paid a visit to veteran BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani in New Delhi on Tuesday. They discussed several issues concerning the development of Jammu and Kashmir and the one related to the present security scenario in the state topped the agenda during the meeting. Gupta briefed Advani regarding the present situation in the Kashmir valley and the measures being taken by the state government to bring back normalcy in the state. The state had suffered a cumulative loss of Rs 10,000 crore in the last three months, with Rs 120 crore loss being added each passing day, Gupta told Advani. “It is not the state government which suffers. The real sufferer is the common man related to tourism, transport and other allied industries,” Gupta said. The Assembly Speaker told Advani that barring a few stone-throwing incidents, the situation was almost under control now. The youth of the Kashmir valley had understood the mentality of separatist leaders and their ill-designs to destabilise the government, he said. Gupta said the time was near when a different Kashmir would be seen. The common man had denounced violence and learnt from mistakes with life starting to come back to normalcy, he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister assured his cooperation in extending all possible support to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
