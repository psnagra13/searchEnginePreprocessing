With Scathing Speech, Jayalalithaa Takes On Karnataka From Hospital Bed
Highlights Jayalalithaa said Karnataka was deliberately defying Supreme Court order "Deliberate defiance is against the spirit of Constitution," she said Speech read out in Delhi during meeting with water minister Uma Bharati

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa today issued a blistering criticism of Karnataka's withholding of Cauvery water, calling it a "a deliberate defiance" of the Supreme Court.From her bed in hospital -- where she had been admitted a week ago for fever and dehydration ", Ms Jayalalithaa said, "The state of Karnataka is treating the orders (of the Supreme Court) with utter contempt."Accusing Karnataka of "orchestrating the violence against Tamils", Ms Jayalalithaa said, "This deliberate defiance goes against the spirit of the Constitution and amounts to contempt of the apex court of the country".Tamil Nadu had a shortfall of 60.983 TMC ft. of water up to August 31 and the state wanted to save at least one Samba (winter) crop in the Cauvery delta. And the Centre, she said, should ensure Karnataka complies with the Supreme Court order and releases waters to Tamil Nadu.The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's speech was read out in Delhi, where Union water minister Uma Bharati held a meeting with Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Tamil Nadu minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, who had been deputed for the meeting by Ms Jayalalithaa.The meeting was held two days day after the Supreme Court admonished Karnataka in strong terms for not releasing the 6,000 cusecs of water a day as per its order, accusing it of violating the spirit of federalism and not being a team player.In the same hearing, the court had asked the Centre to mediate between the two states that have been warring over the Cauvery waters for decades.Today's meeting, however, remained inconclusive. Failing to broker a compromise, Ms Bharati threatened to go on a hunger strike if there was "any problem in either state".With the top court's attempt for a mutually acceptable measure collapsing, many say a tough judicial direction could be inevitable. The court would hear this case on Friday.
