See moment Second World War bomb is detonated on Anglesey
Bomb disposal experts were called in to detonate a Second World War rocket designed to destroy U-Boats.

Soldiers from 721 squadron Royal Logistics Corps were called to land near RAF Valley on Anglesey earlier today to safely explode the device.

The 60lb semi-armour piercing rocket head was used on RAF and RAAF Beaufighter aircraft based at RAF Valley and tasked with anti U-Boat patrols in the Irish Sea during the conflict.

The rocket would have combined an armour piercing head with high explosive to destroy or damage any U-Boat or enemy ship.

RAF Valley have released these amazing pictures of the detonation.

An RAF Valley spokesman said: “It is not known how the rocket head came to be “left behind” after WW2, not much explosive remained in the munition, but nothing was left to chance and it was disposed of safely near Traeth Cymyran.

“RAF personnel from Valley assisted North Wales Police in locating the munition, helping with security and providing imagery to assist the RLC team.

“Our thanks go to our friends and colleagues from NWP, RLC Bomb Disposal and the landowner/tenant of the land where the warhead was found for a job well done.”
