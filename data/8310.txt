NEW DELHI: Leading industrialist Ratan Tata commended the government's decision to boycott the Saarc Summit in the wake of Uri attacks "So proud of Indian govt's firm stand on bycot of SARC mtg & overwhelming support by member nations (sic)," Tata tweeted.The tweet by Tata Group Chairman Emeritus received over 8,000 likes and was re-tweeted more than 5,000 times.Amid heightened tension with Pakistan over Uri terror attack in which 18 jawans were killed, India had announced its decision of pulling out of the Summit late last night citing increased "cross-border" attacks.Apart from India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan have also pulled out of the Saarc Summit in Islamabad in November, indirectly blaming Pakistan for creating an environment which is not right for the successful holding of the meet, resulting in its collapse.
