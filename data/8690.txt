Pak should realise its folly, stop abetting terror: Naidu
NEW DELHI: After India carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the LoC last night, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu today voiced hope that Pakistan will realise its folly and stop aiding and abetting terrorism against India.Emphasising that the operations are a "part of the mandate" of the Indian army to "foil any attempts of infiltration" into Indian soil, Naidu said Pakistan has "not walked the talk" on the promise it made in January 2004 that it would not allow its soil to be used for terrorist activities against India."India has been repeatedly urging Pakistan that its territory should not be allowed for terrorist activities...."They have not walked the talk (on the promise). On the contrary, it has been engaged in aiding, abetting and funding terrorist all these days. In the recent past, many attempts have been made to infiltrate into Indian soil," he said.Stressing that Pakistan should realise its responsibility towards ensuring peace in the region, he said, "Hope at least now Pakistan will realise its folly and stop aiding and abetting terrorism against India."He said the state sponsored terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil has become a threat not only to India but for the entire region as well as the world."We have made all meaningful possible efforts to engage with Pakistan to discuss all issues through dialogue but unfortunately Pakistan has chosen the path of encouraging terrorism," he said.Naidu said India's "positive gestures" were only reciprocated through "further encouragement" to terrorists and also "justifying" the terrorist acts.After the Uri terrorist attack, the minister said people of India were outraged and Prime Minister Narendra Modi reassured the nation that such condemnable acts will not be tolerated anymore and befitting measures will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the country."The operations by our Army yesterday night were part of their responsibility in defending the unity, safety and security of the country," he said, adding that it is proved that country is safe in the hands of Modi and Army.He said Indians across the world are appreciating the steps taken by the Army in countering the terrorist infiltration.Naidu said India is a "peace loving" country but it takes both the countries to realise this goal and asked Pakistan to understand its responsibility.
