A soldier of the Indian Army has been captured by Pakistan. Sources in the Army confirmed that a soldier attached with the 37 Rashtriya Rifles has inadvertently crossed over to the other side of the Line of Control. The captured soldier is not connected to the cross-LoC surgical strike. Pakistan has been informed by the DGMO over the hotline.Such inadvertent crossing by Army and civilians are not unusual on either side and they are returned through existing mechanisms, an Indian Army official said. Meanwhile, the official also refuted reports of killing of eight Indian Army personnel reported in sections of Pakistan media saying it’s “completely false and baseless”.
