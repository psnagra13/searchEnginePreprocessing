Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had vowed to expose the “conspiracy” behind the FIRs against him, AAP ministers and MLAs, may scale down his attack on the Centre during the Special Assembly session on Friday following the prevailing situation after the cross-LoC terror strike.

Sources said “political unanimity” was the need of the hour following which the decision was taken.

“The Chief Minister is likely to postpone the revelations of conspiracy hatched against him and his partymen in the Assembly on tomorrow.

“However, other issues related to dengue and chikungunya will be taken up by the ruling party MLAs on the floor of the House tomorrow,” they said.

Kejriwal, on Tuesday had tweeted, “False cases against AAP MLAs n ministers, FIR against me, CBI raid on me – why? A v big conspiracy. Will expose in Del Assembly on Fri (sic)”.

The move had come after Kejriwal was named in an FIR in alleged irregularities in Delhi Commission for Women by Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) even as the anti-graft body said that he would not be questioned.

The chief minister had alleged that the FIR has been registered against him at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Earlier in the day, the Delhi Chief Minister was to hold a press conference, but it was first postponed and later called off following the “surgical strikes” by the Indian Army.
