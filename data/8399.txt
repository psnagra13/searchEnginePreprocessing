Driving license application to go online in Uttar Pradesh
Driving licences application in Uttar Pradesh would be made online from October 1, an official said on Thursday. While in Lucknow, the online process is the only option, for the other 74 districts the manual process might continue for some time.

All Regional Transport Office’s (RTO) were asked to comply with the new system without fail, by the transport commissioner. This move is aimed at reducing graft in the licensing process.

In a circular to all RTO’s, Transport Commissioner K Ravindra Naik asked officials of Unnao, Hardoi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Rae Bareli, Fatehpur, Sitapur, Kanpur rural, Etawah, Farukkhabad, Kannauj, Banda, Manure, Firozabad, Badayun, Etah, Rampur and Shahjahanpur to meet the October 1 deadline for the online registration process.
