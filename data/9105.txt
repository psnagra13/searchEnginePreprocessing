Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday appeared before a chief judicial magistrate court here in connection with a defamation case filed by a RSS leader over his remark that he was prevented from entering Barpeta Satra — a Vaishnavite monastery — during his visit in December last year.

Rahul had allegedly said that the RSS had conspired to prevent him from paying a visit to the satra.

The court granted him bail on a surety of Rs 50,000, and fixed November 9 as the next date of hearing.

Emerging out of the court, Rahul hit out at the RSS, saying he would fight against such divisive forces.

“I’m against the ideology of the RSS and all other similar organisations which have tried to divide India. My fight is against these forces. I have it in my DNA to fight such divisive forces,” he said, terming the defamation case as a part of a design of the RSS to prevent him from working in the interest of the poor.

“Through these cases they want to disturb my 30-days yatra of UP. But let them file as many cases as they want. I will not be deterred,” he added. ENS
