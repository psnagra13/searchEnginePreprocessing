Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has condemned the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army along the LoC. News agency ANI quoted him as saying, “We condemn this attack, our desire for peace should not be interpreted as our weakness”.

“We are ready for the safety and defence of our country,” said Nawaz Sharif.

“Strongly condemned the unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces resulting in martyrdom of two Pakistan soldiers along LoC,” the Pakistan PM added.

The statements come minutes after the Director General of Military Operation (DGMO) confirmed that the Indian Army had conducted surgical strikes along the LoC. Earlier, it was reported that Pakistani troops Wednesday targeted Indian positions with small firearms along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.

Earlier this month, 19 Indian soldiers were killed in a terror attack at an Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir. It lead to increased tensions along the Line of Control between the countries amid tensions in the Kashmir valley following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani. The attack also drew much international attention towards tensions between India and Pakistan.
