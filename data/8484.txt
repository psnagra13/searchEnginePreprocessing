NEW DELHI: Indian Army on Thursday said thatout a night before on(LoC) in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Lt General Ranbir Singh (DGMO) said thatand that no Indian casualty was suffered.Thewas taken, the DGMO informed. Terrorists were gathering along the LoC with the objective of crossing the border and targetting locations in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as other metros. In such a scenario surgical strikes was considered the best option to deal with the threat.For starters, it is anything but a war or a battle. Surgical strikes are millitary operations undertaken by forces across the world to move on the offensive, hit enemy targets and installations, and return to primary positions - all with lightening speed and with the added precaution of suffering limited casualty.Surgical strikes require not just detailed and exhaustive planning but need to be carried out with absolute precision to achieve the objective of taking down targets with either no or minimal collateral damage.Although details of its most recent surgical strike are still emerging, the Indian Army's strike inside Myanmar in June took 70 commandos all of 40 minutes to kill 38 Naga insurgents.Globally too, millitary forces of several nations rely on such operations to eliminate immediate threats when diplomatic and all other non-millitary channels do not bear fruit.
