Megi, the 17th typhoon this year, brought downpours to the coastal areas of the Fujian province as it made landfall in Quanzhou city with winds packing over 118 km per hour after causing havoc in Taiwan, officials said.

Several houses in the vicinity of 37 kilometres from the county were destroyed and the structures swept away, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

In a separate incident, six persons were reported missing in Baofeng village of Wencheng county last night after their homes were destroyed by a landslide, state-run Xinhua new agency reported.

More than 400 rescuers are on site at Sucun village.

Zhejiang Vice-Governor Sun Jingmiao was leading the rescue operation.

In the province, more than 18,000 people have already been relocated following the heavy rain brought by the typhoon.

Schools and power stations have been inundated in Zhejiang's Pingyang county, which is affected by flood.

Power outages were reported in Shuitou township, home to more than 170,000. Schools across the county remain closed, the local county education bureau said.
