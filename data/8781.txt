Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday stressed on the need for behavioural changes to ensure ‘Swachh Bharat’ and said the country will become literate in the true sense when people stops littering. Speaking to media persons after inaugurating a two-day exhibition on sanitation technologies here, he expressed concern over people behaving in an “irresponsible” manner by throwing litter in the open and being unmindful of cleanliness of public spaces.

“The country will march forward when we stop spitting and littering at public places. It will be literate only when we stop littering. You cannot call yourself literate without stopping littering in public places. This is my advice to all,” the Union minister said. Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation Ramesh Chandappa Gigajinagi was also present on the occasion.

The exhibition has been organised for the benefit of the public and the delegates who will attend the INDOSAN Conference in New Delhi on Friday. Different kinds of tools, equipment and technologies related to various aspects of sanitation chain, including toilets of different kinds, green waste reprocessors, domestic waste water treatment units, plastic recyclers, waste collectors, underground dust bins, construction and demolition waste recyclers are on display.
