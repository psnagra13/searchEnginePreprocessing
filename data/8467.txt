India carries out surgical strikes across LoC; Pak admits 2 of its soldiers killed
'Significant' terrorist casualties, says Indian DGMO

India on Thursday announced that it conducted surgical strikes on Wednesday night to neutralise terrorists waiting on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, emphasising that it remained committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border.

Stating this, Director General of Military Operations, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, said the operation was conducted after specific and credible information about the presence of terrorists at launch pads along the LoC, who were waiting to cross over to carry out attacks in J&K and other parts of the country.

Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Pakistan Army said its troops ‘responded’ to ‘Indian firing’ on the LoC in Bhimber, Hotspring, Kel, and Lipa sectors around 2.30 after midnight. The exchange of fire continued till 8 am. The statement said two of Pakistani soldiers were killed in the action.

It was not clear whether the two sides were referring to the same set of incidents.

General Singh said significant damage was inflicted on terrorists and those supporting them. He said he had spoken to his Pakistan counterpart and hoped the Pakistan army would cooperate with the Indian Army to end terrorism.

Reminding Pakistan that it had not kept its commitment of 2004 of not allowing its soil to be used to launch terror attacks against India, he said India was facing continuing and increasing attacks, including Uri.

DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh addressing the media (MEA video):

Indian security forces, he said, had thwarted 20 infiltration bids. New Delhi also offered consular access to Pakistan to those terrorists apprehended by India, and also to provide fingerprints/DNA samples of those terrorists killed in operations. He said equipment recovered from terrorists included GOS systems with Pakistan markings.
