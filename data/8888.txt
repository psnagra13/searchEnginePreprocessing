Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar briefed the envoys in the South Block to convey the “context” of carrying out the strikes, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup confirmed.

The Foreign Secretary told them that it was “a classic counter-terrorism operation more than a military one” and that it was to neutralise terrorists who were trained to carry out attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and other major Indian cities.

They were also told that India has no plans for any further operation as of now but added the armed forces will not allow terrorists to carry out any attacks.

An all-party meeting chaired by Home Minister Rajnath Singh was also informed about it.

Significantly, earlier in the day American National Security Advisor Susan Rice had spoken to Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and said the US wants Pakistan to “combat and delegitimise” UN-designated terrorist entities, including LeT and JeM.
