A teenage girl walking to school was abducted by two men and subjected to a serious sexual assault.

The girl, who was wearing her school uniform, was grabbed off the street near Marston Ferry Road and Banbury Road at about 08:25 BST on Wednesday.

She was driven away by two men in a silver car and found more than three hours later about a mile away, knocking on doors and seeking help.

Police warned children walking to school to stay in groups.

Supt Christian Bunt, of Thames Valley Police, said: "I would ask parents to consider the safety of their children and if they are walking to school make sure they try to keep in groups.

"I would also ask people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious."

'Very busy area'

The girl was found at midday by officers on Cavendish Drive after she knocked on doors in the area.

Det Ch Insp Simon Steel, who is leading the investigation, said: "I would appreciate the public's help in relation to this very serious incident.

"This happened in what would have been a very busy area at this time of the day and I appeal to anybody who was in that area... to call police immediately.

"It is possible you may have witnessed this incident and may not have realised the severity of the situation."

Police said they are "stepping up patrols in the area to provide reassurance and there will be a very visible police presence whilst the investigation continues".
