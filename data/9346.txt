No offense to all the other Bollywood moms and moms-to-be, but Kareena Kapoor Khan is basically killing it during her pregnancy. She dares to be different as far as her sartorial sense goes even as her baby bump grows, skipping those boring loose and floral garments and really pushing the envelope.Last night saw Kareena wearing an olive-green dress with a thigh-high slit for a party held for aunt Rima Jain and cousin Ranbir Kapoor's joint birthday celebrations, and we can't stop raving about it.Spotted celebrities included best friend Amrita Arora Ladak, who posted a picture with the expectant mother at the party 35-year-old Amrita Instagrammed the with the caption 'Birthday Bumps.'In the picture, Kareena dons the gown, standing in the middle of the group and proudly showing off her baby bump. Actor-husband Saif Ali Khan looped dapper in a Nehru jacket. Sister Karisma Kapoor opted for a modest black outfit accentuated with a pop of red lip colour.Even amongst the star-studded celebration, all eyes were on Kareena and it only made sense.But this isn't the first time that theactress has us stunned by her radiance. She's been at it for quite some time now.Seriously, do you need more proof?Keep slaying 'em, Kareena.
