India's answer to the killing of its 18 Army men in the form of surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) has received an overwhelming response from the social media and people across the country, providing a much-needed relief and respite to the Narendra Modi government battling negative perceptions in the medium following the Uri terror strike. Soon after the announcement at a joint press conference by the external affair and Defence ministries, messages started shooting across the social media congratulating the India armed forces and the country and the way India “distracted” the attention using issues like the Indus Water treaty and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan.

As per BJP leaders, the indication that Pakistan's repeated offences against India would not go unanswered had already been given by the Prime Minister in his speech at the Calicut beach last Saturday. Speaking at a public rally in Kozhikode, the Prime Minister had warned Pakistan that India would never forget the sacrifices made by its 18 soldiers. Battling a sense of deep anger and impatience post-Uri, the BJP and its government was having to deal with another issue—jibes against its leadership, especially the Prime Minister on the social media. The below-the-belt digs, leveraging statements by top leaders, including the Prime Minister, when the BJP was not in power, had become a big cause of concern for the ruling party. While Opposition parties had been criticising the BJP government for practicing an “incoherent policy” on Pakistan, the Uri attack put the Prime Minister’s personal credibility on stake. Some old tweets and statements of the Prime Minister and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj were being pulled out to make fun of the party and its leadership.
