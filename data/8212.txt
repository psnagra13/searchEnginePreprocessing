The Daily Telegraph continues its investigation into allegations of "inappropriate" payments to football managers, saying that Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright has been filmed accepting money to help a fake firm make money from transfers. He denies wrongdoing. Meanwhile, QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has issued a statement in which he says he did not see anything unusual in being offered to be paid to make a speech and he did not make any promises in return.
