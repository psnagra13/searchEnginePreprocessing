Cauvery dispute: Uma Bharti-chaired Karnataka-TN meeting on Cauvery dispute inconclusive
NEW DELHI: A Karnataka-Tamil Nadu meeting chaired by Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti on Thursday was inconclusive, with both states refusing to budge from their respective stands on the Cauvery water sharing issue. Both sides have been at loggerheads as the Supreme Court issued a series of orders this month directing Karnataka to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu The meeting was attended by Karnataka CM Siddaramiah, and a representative of Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. It had been called by the Supreme Court, which has said Karnataka's failure to comply with its order to share Cauvery water with Tamil Nadu violates the spirit of inter-state cooperation."We have asked both states to sit together and solve this problem outside the court, and then approach the court with (a) solution," ANI quoted Uma Bharti as saying on Tuesday."There was a request from Karnataka government to our ministry to form a expert committee to take (into) view the availability of water," she said. "I really appreciate that both the states are trying to find some solution. We have noted their views which will be sent to the Supreme Court," she added.She added that if tensions kept rising at the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, she was willing to "even sit on a indefinite hunger strike there."The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Karnataka to release 6,000 cusecs of Cauvery water to its south-eastern neighbour every day for three days. A day later, the state responded by deferring the decision to release water until today's meeting.Karnataka CM Siddaramiah had on Wednesday said Bharti would be apprised of all "ground realities" at the meeting "We don't want to disrespect the judicial order, but since we have no water, this is a resolution taken by us in (the) legislature. Going by suggestions at the all party meeting and our resolution, we are deferring release till tomorrow."Law Minister T B Jayachandra also defended the move, saying he believed Karnataka was on "firm legal ground.""The legislature is also a constitutional body," he said, referring to the unanimous resolution passed by the Karnataka legislature last Friday to release water only to Bengaluru and towns and villages in the Cauvery basin. "When a constitutional body has passed an unanimous resolution, we need to take its decision also into consideration. Based on both the SC's and legislature's decisions, we decided to defer the matter," he said.With inputs from ANI
