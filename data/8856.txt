Shahabuddin bail: Don't unleash Shahabuddin terror by allowing him out on bail: Bihar government to SC
NEW DELHI: Will criminal turned politician and RJD leader Mohammad Shahabuddin be remain a free bird out on bail or be sent behind bars by cancelling his bail granted by Patna HC? The Supreme Court will deliver its verdict on Friday deciding his fate.A bench of Justices P C Ghose and Amitava Roy reserved its verdict on plea of Bihar government and victim's family seeking cancellation of his bail. Making a last ditch effort to convince the court to send Shahabuddin behind bars, Nitish Kumar government pleaded to the court not to "unleash" the terror of the dreaded criminal on people of Bihar by allowing him to remain out on bail.The court, however, said that a balance has to be maintained between Shahabuddin right to liberty and the apprehension expressed by state that free and fair trial was not possible with him remaining out of jail.The Bihar government, however, was caught unaware and failed to explain when senior advocate Shekar Naphade, appearing for Shahabuddin, alleged that the state was delaying the trial and his client was not supplied chargesheet even 17 months after cognisance was taken by a trial court.Naphade, who has been defensive in his arguments while asking SC not to cancel the bail, delivered a master-stroke by pointing out for the first time that chargesheet was not given to Shahabuddin to defend himself in the case, a fact which was not raised by him in the trial court and the Patna high court earlier.Terming the allegation as very serious, the bench sought Bihar government's response but its counsel Dinesh Dwivedi said that he had to see the records of the case to take stand on the issue. He, however, said that the documents might have been supplied to him as he challenged the trial court order in session court which could only be done if he had got the paper."It is a very serious issue. The chargesheet was not given to him for one and half year. What kind of prosecution is this that for one-and-half years the trial court kept on saying to provide the police records. We have to go by the court orders," the bench said.Naphade said that there was more than meets the eye and accused the present state dispensation for not being fair in its approach. He told the bench that Shahabuddin was ready to abide by any condition imposed by SC and he was ready to stay out of Bihar to allay the apprehension raised by the government.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for victim's father whose three sons were allegedly eliminated by Shahabuddin opposed the contention of Shahabuddin that he was not given chargesheet and told the bench that he could not be allowed to raised the issue in SC as he had maintained silence on it in sessions court and the HC."It is a cock-and-bull story which has been told in the Supreme Court for first time, that too orally without any affidavit. He did not make a whisper on the issue in lower court and HC," he said.
