Prime Minister Narendra Modi may find himself in a Catch-22 situation as both Punjab and Haryana are keen to have him at their respective functions on November 1 to mark the golden jubilee celebrations of creation of the states. Interestingly, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has already announced that Modi will attend the inaugural function of year-long golden jubilee celebrations by the government at Gurgaon on November 1.

Same day, nearly one-month long celebrations by SAD-BJP government will culminate in Amritsar and the state government wants Modi to attend the function. The Akalis have also requested the Prime Minister to attend their function in Punjab, and they are anxiously waiting for the PM’s reply.

“We want the Prime Minister to attend the function in Amritsar on November 1. We have already sent a request regarding this. Now, it depends on his day’s schedule. If his schedule allows, he may attend the celebrations,” Punjab Public Relations Minister Bikram Singh Majithia told The Indian Express.

The golden jubilee celebrations of Punjabi Suba will start on October 3 and culminate on November 1. On October 31, a grand function is also planned in Amritsar. “Arun Jaitley ji will attend the October 31 function. We have also invited Punjabi politicians and ministers from overseas to participate in the celebrations,” Majithia said.
