Lost Jacob Jordaens' masterpiece on show at Swansea Museum
A 17th Century Flemish masterpiece worth about £3m and discovered in Swansea Museum's storeroom goes on show on Thursday.

The "important and beautiful" painting by artist Jacob Jordaens - a pupil of Peter Paul Rubens - was previously unknown to art historians.

The auction record for a work by Jordaens is £3.6m ($4.7m).

The painting was identified by art historian Bendor Grosvenor, for the new BBC Four series, Britain's Lost Masterpieces.
