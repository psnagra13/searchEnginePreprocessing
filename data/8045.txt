New Delhi, September 28

The CBI has decided to initiate an internal inquiry into the allegations levelled by BK Bansal, ex-DG in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, and his son Yogesh in their suicide notes against officials of the agency. Bansal and his son yesterday allegedly committed suicide in their Neelkanth Apartments flat in east Delhi around two months after Bansal’s wife and daughter committed suicide after a case of bribery was registered against the ex-DG and a CBI team questioned his wife. The CBI said, “We have today received communication from the Delhi Police enclosing therewith the purported handwritten notes of BK Bansal, then DG (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and his son Yogesh Bansal. It contains allegations against certain CBI officials in connection with the ongoing bribery investigation against BK Bansal and others. “We have examined the matter and decided to probe the allegations. The CBI is fully committed to conduct investigation in a fair and professional manner without harassment to anyone and strictly within the parameters of law. If any violation is established during the probe, strict action will be taken against the CBI officials concerned. The competent court will be informed.” The CBI spokesperson, however, refused to name the officials named by the Bansals in their suicide notes.
