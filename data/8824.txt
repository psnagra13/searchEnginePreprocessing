A teenage girl who was abducted while walking to school was raped by "more than one man", police have said.

The girl, who was wearing a school uniform, was taken near Marston Ferry Road and Banbury Road in Oxford, at 08:25 BST on Wednesday.

She was driven away by two men in a small, silver hatchback, possibly a Volkswagen, and found more than three hours later about a mile away.

Police have urged anyone who saw the car in the area to contact them.

The girl was found by officers on Cavendish Drive after she knocked on doors in the area.

Police forensics teams have been examining the street for evidence.

'Looked innocent'

Speaking at a press conference Det Supt Chris Ward, head of major crime at Thames Valley Police, said the victim left her house and walked along Banbury Road to Marston Ferry Road where she was abducted.

He said she was approached and possibly hugged, and that it may have looked relatively innocent to witnesses.

The men who abducted her were described as white.

Det Supt Ward appealed for any motorists with dashcams, or cyclists with headcams to come forward, saying the attack could only have happened in a "small geographical area".

He described the girl as "extremely traumatised, extremely upset" and the incident as "very, very, very unusual".

"The vehicle is key to this," he added.

It is not believed the girl knew her attackers.
