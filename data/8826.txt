A commuter train has crashed into a rail station in the city of Hoboken, in the US state of New Jersey.

The New Jersey emergency management system reports more than 100 people have been injured and others are trapped.

Emergency crews have arrived. Photos on social media show extensive damage to the train carriage and station.

A local radio station anchor said the train went through ticket barriers and "into the reception area".

Hoboken is seven miles outside New York City. Many use the station to travel into Manhattan.

Ben Fairclough, an eyewitness who was at the station, told the BBC the train appeared to have completely gone off the track.

"I wasn't on the train, but I arrived just after it happened. There was water coming down off the roof and people climbing out through the windows.

"There were people sitting down with blood coming from their head. There were lots of injuries."

The New Jersey Transit posted on Twitter the service out of the Hoboken station would be suspended due to the crash.
