Land Rover has revealed the New Discovery seven-seat SUV by breaking a Guinness World Record for the largest LEGO structure ever built.

Long-term Land Rover Discovery owner Bear Grylls, who owns St Tudwall's island off the Llyn Peninsula, took part in the dynamic live reveal around a 13-metre high LEGO version of London’s Tower Bridge.

As part of the dramatic sequence, British adventurer Bear Grylls appeared in typically exciting fashion by abseiling from the top of the huge Tower Bridge installation, through the open drawbridge and onto the stage beside the New Discovery.

Gerry McGovern, Land Rover’s chief design officer, said: "New Discovery redefines the large SUV. Land Rover’s design and engineering teams have revolutionised the Discovery DNA to create a highly desirable, extremely versatile and hugely capable premium SUV."

Land Rover's original vehicle was dreamt up on Red Wharf Bay by Maurice Wilks.
