The SC today grilled the Bihar Government for letting RJD leader Mohd Shahabuddin come out of jail by getting bail in as many as 40 cases, and now seeking to put him back behind the bars even as the ex-gangster pleaded he had been made a punching bag and a victim of media trial. “You came out of slumber after Shahabuddin was finally out of jail despite the fact that he was sentenced to life in two cases and awarded a cumulative jail term of another 30 years in eight other cases, a Bench comprising Justices PC Ghose and Amitava Roy told Bihar’s senior counsel Dinesh Dwivedi. I do not want to defend what has happened. I only want to put forth the reasons for which his bail should be cancelled,” Dwivedi pleaded. Despite remaining in jail since 2005, Shahabuddin kept on committing heinous crimes.
