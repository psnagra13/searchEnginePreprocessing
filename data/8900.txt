Legia Warsaw must play Real Madrid in an empty stadium as punishment for fan violence and racist behavior at a Champions League match.

UEFA says its disciplinary panel ordered the sanction to apply when Madrid visits the Polish Army Stadium on Nov. 2. Legia was also fined 80,000 euros ($90,000).

UEFA charged Legia over incidents during a 6-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund two weeks ago. It was the Polish championâ€™s first home game in the group stage of the Champions League in 20 years.

Fans clashed with stadium security staff, threw objects and lit fireworks, and discrimination monitors reported anti-Semitic abuse.

Legia lost 2-0 at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday in Group F. It next plays at Madrid on Oct. 18.
