The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been censured over the death of a soldier who was shot in the neck during a training exercise.

Fusilier Dean Griffiths, 21, of First Battalion the Royal Welsh, died at Lydd Range, Kent in September 2011.

An inquest in 2013 heard a target was wrongly placed against a wall but there was no evidence it was malicious.

A Crown Censure is the maximum sanction the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) can impose on a government body.

The MoD cannot be prosecuted in the same way as non-Government bodies.
