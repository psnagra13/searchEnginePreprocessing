The government today announced a productivity-linked bonus equal to 78-day salary for all non-gazetted Railways employees. The employees will get the bonus for fifth consecutive year this time. The decision to grant the bonus was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by PM Narendra Modi. “The government has approved the pay productivity-linked bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78-day wages to eligible non-gazetted Railways employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) for the financial year 2015-16,” an official statement said. Productivity-linked bonus is paid to about 12 lakh railway employees each year before the Dussehra festival. The approval entails a financial implication of around Rs 2,090.96 crore. “We have demanded 78-day wages as productivity-linked bonus (PLB) for the Railways employees this year. We are happy that the government has agreed to our proposals,” National Federation of Indian Railwaymen general secretary M Raghavaiah said. He said the 78-day wages would mean around Rs 18,000 per employee.
