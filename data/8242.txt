At least 26 people are missing in China's eastern Zhejiang province after heavy rains triggered a landslide which engulfed parts of a village.

The landslide destroyed several houses in Sucun in Suichang county, said state media.

Rescuers managed to pull 15 people out, and are digging through the debris for survivors.

A video posted on Twitter by the Xinhua state news agency showed a mass of debris sliding down the mountain.

The rains were caused by Typhoon Megi, which has already killed one person in mainland China and four in Taiwan.

Hundreds of people have also been injured by the storm, which at its height over Taiwan had winds of up to 160 km/h (100mph).

Millions of homes were also left without power and severe flooding hit parts of China's Fujian province.

State media said some areas of Fujian saw more than 300mm of rain in two days.
