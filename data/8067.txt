Selectors Khoda, Paranjpe likely to be removed
kolkata, September 28

Under fire due to a stinging status report filed by the Justice RM Lodha Committee, the BCCI is likely to remove senior national selectors Gagan Khoda and Jatin Paranjpe in the Special General Meeting (SGM) on Friday. The Lodha panel has recommended to dissolve the current BCCI regime and wants all the decisions taken by BCCI, post the Supreme Court verdict on July 18, to be superseded. While there is a possibility that the entire selection committee may be overhauled but Khoda and Paranjpe’s ouster now looks imminent as their appointments were in direct violation of the Lodha panel’s recommendations. Both Khoda (2 ODIs) and Paranjpe (4 ODIs) have never played Test cricket which the Lodha panel made mandatory for the appointment in the senior selection panel. The panel also wanted the number of selectors to be restricted to three only. While Khoda was from the earlier panel, Mumbai batsman Paranjpe was inducted during the AGM on September 21. The three others in the panel are MSK Prasad, Devang Gandhi and Sarandeep Singh — all Test players but with collective experience of 13 matches in the longest format. — PTI
