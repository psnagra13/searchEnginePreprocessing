Sir Cliff Richard is performing a "duet" with none other than the late Elvis Presley on his 101st album.

Sir Cliff, 75, sings Blue Suede Shoes with the late rocker on his latest release.

Just... Fabulous Rock 'n' Roll is being released in November.

News of the forthcoming album comes days after the Crown Prosecution Service upheld a decision not to prosecute Sir Cliff over claims of historical sex offences.

Sir Cliff, who always denied the allegations, said he was "pleased" with the decision and said he hoped the review "brings this matter to a close".

'Happy, creative and innocent time'

The veteran rocker recorded the album in the Blackbird studio in Nashville, Tennessee, fulfilling his long-held dream of a "duet" with Elvis.

The album also includes Sir Cliff's version of songs recorded by his "heroes", including hits by Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke and John Lee Hooker.

Tracks include Roll Over Beethoven, Great Balls Of Fire and Sweet Little Sixteen, as well as a new, original track, It's Better To Dream, and Sir Cliff's debut single Move It, first released in August 1958.

He said the album reflected "a happy, creative, and in many ways an innocent time", adding: "Not only do I find it hard to believe that my career has spanned this length of time, but also that I still get the chance to do the thing I love best, and that is to get into a studio."
