CSK and RR had moved the Bombay High Court in April, against the levying of franchise fees by the BCCI.

The BCCI had decided for an out of court settlement by waiving the annual franchise fees to these two teams during their suspensions at its working committee meeting held in New Delhi last month.

The BCCI also rewarded the Hyderabad Cricket Association with a cash prize of Rs 28.75 lakh for providing good wickets and outfield for IPL 2016.
