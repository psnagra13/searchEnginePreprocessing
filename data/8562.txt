Jobs on offer range from hospitality roles to full time and temporary Christmas retail positions.

As well as retailers, partners such as the local Job Centre will be on hand to provide employment advice, including support with CV writing and completing online applications.

Alan Barker, centre manager at Broughton, said: “We’re expecting thousands of people to attend our jobs fair this year.

"There are some brilliant opportunities for people of all ages looking for a new role or even their first experience within the retail sector.

“Last year’s event was successful in finding hundreds of jobseekers positions at the centre, and over half of the seasonal roles went on to be made permanent."

The annual jobs fair will take place at Broughton from 10am to 4pm on Saturday October 1.
