Here's why Priyanka might replace Aishwarya
There is no denying that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is back to setting the silver screen ablaze with her impeccable chemistry with Ranbir Kapoor in 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and one would only expect her growing popularity to add brownie points to her brand value as well. However, that's not how things look so far. As per the latest reports, the popular international hair care brand that Ash has been endorsing for years now, have decided to replace her with none other than Priyanka Chopra, who too has been gaining momentum with her international fame. PeeCee's successful stint in super hit American TV series, 'Quantico' and her much-talked about Hollywood debut 'Baywatch' alongside Dwayne Johnson, have taken her global appeal to another level and hence, the brand now wants Priyanka to be the face of their products. Talk about a former Miss World replacing another! According to reports, the said brand wants a younger and an equally popular star and PeeCee perfectly fits the bill. Considering Priyanka has increased her remuneration after her growing global popularity, it remains to be seen if her demands would be met with or the brand continues with Ash!
