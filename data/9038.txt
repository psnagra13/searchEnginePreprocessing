Delhi High Court Seeks Reply From Nearby States On Crop Stubble Burning
The Delhi High Court today directed Resident Commissioners of four neighbouring states to file their response on the issue of burning of crop stubble, which spikes air pollution in the capital every year during October-November.A division bench of Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Ashutosh Kumar asked the Resident Commissioners of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to send a representative before the court to explain their respective action plans to tackle burning of crop stubble.The bench observed that around Diwali time, Delhi is engulfed in a cloud of haze because of burning of biomass and crop stubble, which leads to respiratory problems both in elders and the young."Although prohibited by various laws, each year around the time of Diwali, Delhi is engulfed in a cloud of haze, of which the largest contributor is burning of biomass and crop stubble," said the bench."These are leading to respiratory problems both in elders and the young. Certain percentages of these air pollutants are carcinogenic -- having the potential to cause cancer. Some of them are so small Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) that they can get absorbed in the blood," it added.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) initiated by it on the issue of air pollution in the national capital.A new report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on ambient air pollution levels puts Delhi among the most polluted cities in the world.During the hearing, the court noted that the burning of crop stubble will begin in another three weeks' time, if it does not pass any order to stop it.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on October 6.
