Sourav Ganguly survived a scare at his very own Eden Gardens when the club house lift of more than 29 years old malfunctioned and the former India captain had to be pulled out using a stool on the eve of the second Test versus New Zealand.

On his way to his office on the first floor, the old manually operated grill door lift got stuck between the two levels and the securitymen quickly pressed into action to avoid any mishap.

“We quickly disconnected the power and manually opened the door. A stool was lowered inside and Dada came out by climbing on it,” a security official told PTI.

A switch-over in power supply led to this embarrassing incident around 5pm.

“When such things happen we quickly turn off the power and open the grill lock manually,” the security added.

The lift was installed during the renovation work of the stadium way back in 1987 when it hosted the World Cup final, a former CAB secretary said.

The fabled Eden has gone for a major facelift in the 2011 World Cup but the age old lift has remained untouched and incidentally this is the only lift that the iconic BC Roy Clubhouse has.

“We have proposal to change the lift and install a high tech automatic one but it will take sometime,” the official added.
