No village in Rajasthan will be evacuated even though the authorities have announced a "high alert" along the international border following the surgical strikes by India on terror launchpads across the Line of Control last night.Rajasthan home minister Gulab Chand Katariya called for a high level meeting to review the security situation in the state today, which shares more than 1,000 km in border with Pakistan on its west.The meeting was attended by the chief secretary OP Meena, home secretary Deepak Upreti, police chief Manoj Bhatt, Army's sub-area commander Maj Gen Pankaj Saxena and Col (GS) Harsh Vardhan."We are alert, our police stations on the border are on alert. In fact not from today, but for the past three days. But there is no move to evacuate any villages in Rajasthan and no plan to do so either," said Mr Katariya.The imposition of orders banning large gatherings in border areas is routine and has not been especially imposed now, the home minister said.Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said Pakistan had been given a befitting reply and said the Indian soldiers should be saluted.All district collectors of the three border districts of Barmer, Jaislamer and Ganganagar and have been put on alert and the Inspectors General of Police have been asked to stay in the districts.Residents of nearly 1,000 villages in Punjab districts bordering Pakistan are being evacuated.The Border Security Force (BSF) has issued orders to all its units along the border in Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat to step up vigil and call in all personnel who are in the reserve.Officials also said BSF has also restricted all civilian movement along borders with Pakistan. Border units have been asked to undertake special patrols and conduct ambushes.India carried out 'surgical strikes' on terror launch pads across the Line of Control or LoC last night, inflicting "significant casualties" on terrorists and those who are trying to support them.The announcement of the action by the Army was made today, 11 days after the terror strike by Pakistan-based terrorists on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Kashmir which left 18 Indian soldiers dead.
