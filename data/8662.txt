Horse killed in horror Sychnant Pass crash
A car crashed into a horse and killed it on Sychnant Pass.

North Wales Police are investigating after the animal died but miraculously the rider escaped with minor injuries after the horse landed on her.

Two riders were on a hack towards Dwygyfylchi when a car hit the back of one horse.

At 5.52pm on Wednesday the emergency services were called to Sychnant Pass near Conwy .

The road was blocked for half an hour as heavy machinery was used to remove the dead horse.

Keelie Owen told the Daily Post: “Two experienced horse riders who are my close family members both women in their 50s with 40 plus years of riding experience were hacking on the road heading towards Dwygyfylchi yesterday when a man driving a car hit the back end of one of the horses.

“The horse and rider fell to the floor with the impact.

“The horse landed on top of the rider but by some miracle she only had minor injuries.

“But unfortunately due to the trauma caused to the horse he died at the scene from leg and internal injuries.”

Keelie added: “The women were so understandably distressed they did not take all details of witnesses as I’m lead to believe there were some other road users passing at the time.

“The riders were very experienced. They have ridden those roads for many years.

"They were wearing all the correct equipment.”

A spokeswoman for North Wales Police said: “The driver has been traced and investigations are on going.”
