The refugees still trying to reach EU via Balkans
The BBC has learned that at least a 1,000 refugees and migrants each week are trying to reach the EU via the Balkans.

That is despite the claim by the President of the European Council Donald Tusk that migrant flows along the route had come to an end.

Damian Grammaticas reports on the dangerous journeys taken by those attempting to get to the EU, and the harshness of life for the thousands still in refugee camps in Greece.
