Centre should consult states on education policy, says West Bengal minister Bratya Basu
IT Minister Bratya Basu Thursday hit out at the Centre’s proposed education policy, which, he alleged, was weakening the federal structure.

“The Centre is announcing various schemes regarding the education system. They are announcing various schemes for the education policy, but are not releasing funds for implementing these schemes, rather they have slashed funds. They are unanimously taking decisions about these schemes,” Basu said in Kolkata. “Our view regarding the education policy is that we want to collaborate, but we don’t want the federal structure to be weakened,” he added.

Basu claimed that an “unplanned fiasco” can “jeopardize” the entire country’s education system. “They have cut down on funding for education, reducing expenditure on mid-day meals in a unilateral fashion, without attempting to understand what the states are doing. Such unplanned fiasco will jeopardize everything,” he said.
