Delhi Commission For Women Sends Notice To CBI In Bureaucrat Suicide Case
The Delhi Commission for Women today served a notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation seeking details about the action taken by the agency, after a top government official and his son blamed them of harassment in their suicide note.Delhi's women panel chief Swati Maliwal said a notice had been issued to CBI director Anil Kumar Sinha asking him to conduct and "unbiased" inquiry in the matter.Police found the bodies of former Director General of Corporate Affairs BK Bansal - who was being investigated in a corruption case - and his son Yogesh hanging in their home on Tuesday. Two months ago, his wife Satyabala and daughter Neha had also hanged themselves alleging harassment by the CBI.In his suicide note, recovered by the police, Mr Bansal alleged that a senior CBI officer, two women officers and a "fat" CBI agent had tortured his wife and daughter which led to their eventual suicide in July."We have issued a notice to CBI director seeking details about the action that will be taken against the CBI officers named in the suicide note. Are they going to register an FIR? We want details about how they are going to conduct a transparent inquiry in the matter since the notes name a senior politician and high-ranking CBI officer," Ms Maliwal said.In the notice sent to the CBI, the women's panel has sought to know whether the "possibility of conducting narco-tests on all those named in the suicide note" is being explored."The suicide notes (of Mr Bansal and his wife) raise several questions on the CBI. It is written that his wife and daughter committed suicide due to CBI harassment. We are not passing judgment on whether he was corrupt or not, but we want answers from the CBI," she said.The CBI has 48 hours to respond to the notice issued by the Delhi Commission for Women.
