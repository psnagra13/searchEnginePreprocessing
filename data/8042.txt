Hyderabad, September 28

The State Minorities Commission for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has opposed the triple talaq system, saying it is causing untold miseries to millions of Muslim women. Commission Chairman Abid Rasool Khan has written to the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), urging it to change its stand on the issue. “The triple talaq issue has the potential to escalate and cause eventual de-recognition of the Muslim Personal Law and imposition of uniform civil code,” Khan said in his letter to AIMPLB president Moulana Syed Mohammed Rafi Hussaini Nadvi. He also addressed a similar letter to the Jamiat-Ulema-I-Hind, expressing his views. “I would like to alert you that if you (AIMPLB) insist on the triple talaq, you will be committing injustice to lakhs of our sisters and opening the doors for the SC to strike down this law as it is seen as being in violation of human rights,” he said in the letter. AIMPLB members dismissed Khan’s views as “unsolicited advice” and firmly ruled out any relook at the practice of the triple talaq.
