Decision on Pakistan's MFN status today, PM Modi to hold review meeting
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting on Thursday to review the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status granted to Pakistan The decision to review the MFN status comes in the wake of the Uri attack after which India is weighing various options to respond and isolate Islamabad.Among others, officials from commerce and external affairs ministries are expected to attend the meeting.The meeting, according to sources, may deliberate upon the option of dragging Pakistan to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism for not according similar status to India.India granted the MFN status to Pakistan in 1996 but Pakistan is yet to reciprocate to that. The neighbouring country has missed its own deadline of December 2012 for this.Under MFN, a WTO member country is obliged to treat other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies.According to experts, withdrawal of the MFN status by India is likely to hurt Pakistani industries as it might stop flow of raw materials at competitive prices.In 2015-16, India's exports to Pakistan stood at $2.17 billion, while imports were $441 million.As per the WTO rules, India can roll back the MFN status from Pakistan.This meeting comes after the Prime Minister chaired a review meeting of 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty during which it was decided that India will "exploit to the maximum" the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per the water sharing pact.India's main exports to Pakistan include sugar, cotton, man-made filaments, chemicals, carpets, furniture fresh fruits and vegetables while its imports comprise mineral fuels, precious stones, wooden handicrafts among others.
