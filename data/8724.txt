A woman who campaigned to raise awareness of sepsis following the death of her one-year-old son has given birth to a boy.

Melissa Mead's son William died of blood poisoning following a chest infection in December 2014.

Since William's death she and her partner Paul have campaigned to raise awareness of the condition.

The couple, from Penryn, Cornwall, named the baby Arthur William Mead. He was born on 27 September.

Mr Mead shared pictures of baby Arthur on Facebook.

"Melissa has been amazing as usual and Arthur is just perfect. We all want to thank everyone in advance for messages as it could take a while before we get round to answering them as we have our hands full," he said in the post.

In an emotional video issued earlier this month Mrs Mead shared information about how common sepsis is and how William would not get to meet his brother.
