India on Thursday confirmed a surgical strike was conducted on terror launch pads late Wednesday along the Line of Control (LoC) that caused significant casualties to terrorists and those who support them. The announcement was made by DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh during a joint press conference with the Ministry of External Affairs.

“Significant casualties have been caused to terrorists and those trying to shield them. We don’t have a plan to further conduct such strikes. India has spoken to Pakistan,” DGMO Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said.

“We have recovered items including GPS which have Pakistani markings. Captured terrorists hailing from PoK or Pakistan have confessed to their training in Pakistan or in Pakistan controlled region,” Singh said, referring to infiltration attempts along the LoC.

Pakistan, however, has dismissed India’s claim of surgical strike and has termed it as a “quest” by India to create media hype by re-branding cross-border fire as a surgical strike. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and said, “We condemn this attack, our desire for peace should not be interpreted as our weakness.”
