How PM Modi is turning the heat on Pakistan
NEW DELHI: No one can blame Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not trying hard enough to have a peaceful relationship with Pakistan. Right from inviting Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his oath-taking ceremony, greeting him on Eid to visiting him in Lahore, PM Modi had made earnest efforts to normalize India-Pakistan relations.Sadly, PM Modi's every offer of friendship to Pakistan was met with a series of betrayals in the form of cross-border terror attacks: From Gurdaspur to Pathankot to Uri. However, In the face of unabated cross-terror attacks, PM Modi has, slowly but surely, changed the tack on Pakistan. Here is how India is turning the heat on Pakistan:Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that Uri attack would not go unpunished and that the sacrifice of 18 jawans will not go in vain, India has carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC with the Army inflicting "significant casualties" on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Seven terror launch pads across the Line of Control(LoC) were targeted by the Army on the intervening night of September 28 and 29 in a nearly five-hour-long operation during which heliborne and ground forces were deployed, defence sources said today.They said the launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) were in the range of 2 to 3km from the LoC and were under surveillance for over one week while Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the strikes targeted 5-6 places along Kupwara and Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir. Naidu said there was no casualty on the Indian side.Reports said around 40 terrorists were present in the seven launch pads and they may have been killed. However, there was no official word on it.In the wake of Uri terror attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had vowed to mount a global campaign to isolate Pakistan. Acting on his promise to launch a campaign to isolate Pakistan globally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 27 decided not to attend the SAARC summit to be held in November in Islamabad. "India has conveyed to current SAARC chair Nepal that increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of member states by one country have created an environment that is not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th SAARC summit in Islamabad in November 2016," the external affairs ministry said in a statement.India's efforts to isolate Pakistan on the issue of exporting terror have shown results in South Asia with Afghanistan, Bhutan and Bangladesh pulling out of the scheduled SAARC summit in Islamabad, leading to collapse of the meet.India has also started a campaign to isolate Pakistan at the United Nations. "In our midst, there are nations that still speak the language of terrorism, that nurture it, peddle it, and export it. To shelter terrorists has become their calling card. We must identify these nations and hold them to account," external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj asserted in her nearly 20-minute speech at the UN, calling for global isolation of Pakistan.Taking the offensive right into the heart of Pakistan, India has decided to suspend the meeting of the Indus Water Commission and explore ways to use its share of water of rivers flowing into Pakistan, besides hinting that it could revive construction of the Tulbul project in Jammu & Kashmir."Blood and water cannot flow simultaneously," Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a meeting where the decisions designed to make Pakistan pay for the terrorist attack on the Uri Army camp were taken, extending the retaliation against the strike beyond efforts to isolate Pakistan diplomatically.In fact, sources said, India could even consider walking out of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) if Pakistan does not rein in terrorists, adding that the water-sharing pact is not sacrosanct.India announced a series of actions on the IWT, seen as "incredibly generous to Pakistan", which would substantially increase its usage of the three rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - which feed Pakistan. Although India is entitled to use 20% of the three rivers, it has not availed of the provision so far, much to the comfort of Pakistan, which is critically dependent on the western rivers of the Indus system. A move by India to use its share will hurt Pakistan, reeling from worsening water scarcity, but without attracting the charge of violation of the treaty.Significantly, the construction of the Tulbul project will benefit J&K, which has clamoured for a greater share of Indus waters, with the assembly even passing a resolution for the multi-purpose project.In recent months, India has upped the ante against Pakistan on the Balochistan issue. India has raised the issue of Pakistani forces' atrocities in Balochistan at the United Nations Human Rights Councit(UNHRC) and at other international forums.That India is going to corner Pakistan over the Balochistan issue was made clear by PM Modi himself when he mentioned about in it his Independence Day speech. Modi's tone sounded pacifist but it sent a different message to Pakistan's military intelligence leadership: "I want to express my gratitude to the people of Balochistan, Gilgit & PoK for the way they whole-heartedly thanked me, the way they expressed gratitude to me.... People of a distant land I haven't even seen....When they thank the Indian PM, it's an honour for the 125 crore people of the country..."This was the first instance of an Indian PM using a platform such as Red Fort to tell Islamabad that New Delhi too can target its integrity and unity the way Pakistan does.Tightening the screws on Pakistan further, PM Narendra Modi is also working to review the Most Favoured Nation(MFN) status granted to it in trade.The MFN status was accorded in 1996 under WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Both India and Pakistan are signatories to this which means they have to treat each other and rest of WTO member countries as favoured trading partners.According to Assocham, out of India's total merchandise trade of $641 billion in 2015-16, Pakistan accounted for a meagre $2.67 billion.(With inputs from agencies)
