Hockey: India defeat Pakistan 3-1 to reach U18 Asia Cup final
The Indian hockey team produced a superior performance as they outplayed arch rival Pakistan 3-1 in the U18 Asia Cup semifinal clash in Dhaka on Thursday.

The Indians made their intentions clear with an early strike to go 1-0 up and doubled the lead moments before half time.
