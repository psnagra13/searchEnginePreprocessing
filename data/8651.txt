Tinder now allows user to have their profile be on top of all others in the area for 30 minutes, with Tinder Boost. According to the company, this will increase your chances for a match and give a ten-fold increase in profile views.

“You’ve got people to meet and places to be. In fact, Tinder was designed with this in mind, providing you a simple, fun introduction to new people nearby so you can get out and meet them in the real world. Still, sometimes there just aren’t enough hours in the day and what you need is a boost in the right direction,” the company said in a statement.

The Boost mode can be activated if the user is on Tinder mode. Tinder Plus users will get one Boost every week at no extra charge, but if they find need for the feature – they can buy the boost through in-app purchases. Users who do not have Tinder Plus will also be able to buy the Boost.

Tinder Boost is currently available to users in Australia, but it will start rolling out in other markets soon.

Tinder had rolled out ‘Tinder Social’ back in July, that allowed users to create a group of friends (also on Tinder Social) that can then be swiped left or right by other groups. If there is a right swipe, the two groups are combined into one single chat message. Groups are able to assign an activity to their status like “Comedy Night”, “Girl’s Night Out”, “Pub Crawl” and more.
