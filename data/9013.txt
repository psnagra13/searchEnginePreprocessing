Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said its donut chain, Dunkin' Donuts, will partner with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to launch a line of cold coffee beverages in the United States, its first foray into the ready-to-drink coffee market.

The donut chain operator said the beverages, set to launch in early 2017, will be manufactured, distributed and sold by Coca-Cola.

The bottled iced coffees will be sold at grocery, convenience stores, mass merchandizers and Dunkin' Donuts restaurants.

The company did not disclose financial terms of the deal.
