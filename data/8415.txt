The MFN status was accorded in 1996 under WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Both India and Pakistan are signatories to this which means they have to treat each other and rest of WTO member countries as favoured trading partners. According to Assocham, out of India's total merchandise trade of US$ 641 billion in 2015-16, Pakistan accounted for a meagre US$ 2.67 billion. India's exports to the neighbouring country worked out to US$ 2.17 billion, or 0.83 per cent, of the total Indian outward shipments while imports were less than US$ 500 million, or 0.13 per cent, of the total inward shipments. â€” With PTI inputs
