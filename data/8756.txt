VW boss: Emissions scandal 'a huge mistake'
Matthias Mueller, the chief executive of German car giant VW, says the firm made a 'huge mistake' in using technology in its diesel cars to cheat on emissions tests.

The firm is struggling to draw a line under the worst crisis in its 78-year history. Mr Mueller told the BBC's Theo Leggett the firm was seeking to resolve the crisis with the authorities in Europe and the US so it could plan for the future from a sound base.

VW has just unveiled its latest electric car at the Paris Motor Show, which it hopes will be a big seller by 2025.
