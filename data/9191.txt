Goa BJP unit today hailed the Army for successfully carrying out surgical strikes across the Line of Control.

“It is indeed a proud movement for India, especially Goans as the Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar hails from the coastal state,” Goa BJP chief Vinay Tendulkar told reporters here.

“We congratulate Indian Army, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister for (taking) such a major step,” he said.

Tendulkar said the Modi-led government had said that it would not let the sacrifice of 19 soldiers killed in Uri attack go in vain.

“Our government is different. We just don’t make statements. We have proved that we act,” he added.

In a first, India carried out surgical strikes on seven terror launch pads across the LoC with the Army inflicting “significant casualties” on terrorists preparing to infiltrate from PoK, days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Uri attack would not go unpunished.
