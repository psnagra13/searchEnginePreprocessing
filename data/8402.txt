Rahul Gandhi: I am against the ideology of RSS, says Rahul Gandhi
NEW DELHI: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he is against the ideology of RSS and other organisations that try to divide the nation.Speaking to reporters after appearing in a court in Assam in connection with a defamation case for his comments against the RSS, Rahul said, "These cases are being filed against me because I am fighting for the poor people, rights of farmers, and unemployed youth.Rahul said he won't be scared by these cases and will continue his struggle."I'll not be deterred. I am happy, let them file as many cases as they want, I'll continue to fight for the unity of this country," the Congress vice-president said.An RSS volunteer had filed a defamation suit against Rahul Gandhi last year regarding his visit to the Barpeta Satra , a 16th century Vaishnavite monastery on December 12 last year.Rahul was supposed to enter the Satra before taking part in a road show, organised nearby, but did not do so and instead hit the road show directly.Later in New Delhi, he told media persons that some RSS workers prevented him from entering the Satra. He also alleged that the RSS have incited the local women to prevent him from entering the Satra.In his complaint the volunteer not only denied the role of RSS in the incident but also alleged that Rahul Gandhi's statement to media in New Delhi had tarnished the image of the Satra.The court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup after examining different witnesses had asked Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on September 29."Rahul was allowed by the court to go on a bond of Rs 50,000," RSS lawyer Bijan Mahajan said.
