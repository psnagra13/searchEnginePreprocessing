This video shows the latest stage in the demolition of Rhyl Sun Centre.

Heavy plant machinery could last night be seen continuing to tear down the inside of the iconic 34-year-old attraction.

Contractors moved onto the site on East Parade earlier this month.

Starting internally, the project is being carried out in phases by Caerphilly-based Bond Demolition Ltd as part of a major revamp of Rhyl’s waterfront.

Once demolition is complete, work will then start on the neighbouring Pavilion theatre’s ground and first floor areas as well as creating a new façade for the building.

There will also be space created to hold events including craft stalls, an ice rink and Santa’s grotto where the Sun Centre currently stands.

The proposed centre will comprise 2,250sqm of events space, with standing events able to accommodate 4,100 people and seated performances 2,500.

A new water attraction has been earmarked for a site on West Parade and plans are expected to be unveiled next month.

The waterfront development project is worth £29m and has been funded partly by the Welsh Government and Denbighshire council, with the remainder from private sector investment being secured by Neptune Developments Ltd.
