Are friends trying to play cupid for Sidharth Malhotra and Katrina Kaif?
Katrina Kaif and Sidharth Malhotra gave major relationship goals in their recent rom-com 'Baar Baar Dekho'. Though the film did not fare as well as expected, the scorching chemistry between Sidharth and Katrina didn't go unnoticed.

However, it seems some of their industry friends liked it so much that they want Katrina and Sidharth to give each other a chance in real life!

Katrina, who had a high-profile breakup with long time beau Ranbir Kapoor, is still apparently recovering and Sidharth has also broken up with alleged girlfriend Alia Bhatt.

Reportedly, the actors' friends from the industry are trying to play matchmakers for this good-looking duo.

Well, it will be interesting to see how things work out between the two as they are said to share great rapport and friendship.
