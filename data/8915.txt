Christmas jobs: EVERY Argos store in North Wales now recruiting for seasonal roles
Catalogue shop Argos has launched its Christmas recruitment drive with around 140 jobs up for grabs.

There are 10 stores across North Wales that are all seeking staff to help them cope with the festive rush.

There were also positions in Mid-Wales at Aberystwyth and Newtown, and just across the border in Oswestry.

Argos said that while the jobs are recruited on short-term contracts, stores do look to turn these into permanent roles wherever possible.

Steve Carson, director of retail and customer operations, at Argos said: "The Christmas period is naturally an extremely busy and exciting time of year for Argos and our ability to offer more than 60,000 products for the whole family is why millions of people shop with us over the festive season.

"Job creation is one of the most important contributions we make to the communities in which we serve and we are committed to maintaining the friendly, personal service we are known for, whether customers are shopping in-store or buying online for home delivery.

"The work is fast-paced, varied and rewarding with the potential to learn a whole set of new skills.

"Many in the past have gone on to develop their career with us and progress rather rapidly to run a team, department or even store, helping to drive sales and deliver great customer service."
