Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held a meeting with senior members and officials of the party’s Assam unit after he was granted relief by a local court in a criminal defamation case filed against him by an RSS functionary.

“Gandhi met state leaders and took stock of the political scenario here. He appreciated former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi’s active participation in all party programmes. He said Gogoi is still working like a youth,” Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) spokesperson said. Gandhi also lauded the organisational skills of new Assam Congress chief Ripun Bora and hoped the party will be stronger now, he said.

“The Congress vice president also discussed strategies for bye-election of Lakhimpur Lok Sabha seat which fell vacant after Sarbananda Sonowal became the Chief Minister of Assam,” the spokesperson said. Gandhi also met the party workers in Guwahati and appealed to them to work for the poor and marginalised section of the society, he added.

Gandhi had appeared as accused before the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Kamrup and was granted Personal Recognisance (PR) bond as he appeared personally and in deference to his status as MP. The complainant had filed a criminal defamation case against Gandhi alleging that he had brought down the image of the RSS by saying he was not allowed by RSS members to enter Barpeta Satra, a 16th century Vaishnavite monastery, in Assam on December 12 last year.
