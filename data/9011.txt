A driverâ€™s idiotic overtaking manoeuvre at traffic lights on red has been captured on dash-cam.

A black Vauxhall Astra, is seen crossing white lines on the wrong side of the road when motorists had stopped at lights at the Mold A5119 junction near Theatr Clwyd.

The move was filmed by a dash mounted camera.

In the footage a car looking to turn right in the opposite direction flashes its lights at the driver as it zooms off into the distance.

Overtaking on solid white lines or when lights are on red is illegal.

It is not the first time near misses have been captured on dash-cams across North Wales.

In January this year a car was filmed overtaking dangerously close to a roundabout on the approach into Tremadog from the Porthmadog bypass.

Then in October last year lorry driver, Mark Owen had to slam on the brakes when a vehicle cut across him from the right hand lane on the A55 after the driver suddenly decides to exit the westbound expressway towards Mold.
