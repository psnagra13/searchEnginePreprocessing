Police are continuing to question a man on suspicion of murdering a couple who were found stabbed on a Cardiff street near to where they worked.

Matalan workers Zoe Morgan, 21, and Lee Simmons, 33, were found dead close to the store on Queen Street at about 05:50 BST on Wednesday.

A man from Castleton, Newport, who is known to the couple, is in custody.

He was arrested within an hour of their bodies being found and officers are not looking for anyone else.

Former University of South Wales fashion student Miss Morgan, of Llandaff North, worked as a visual merchandiser at the store, while Mr Simmons, of Grangetown, was a sales assistant.

The pair had been in a relationship since July.

In a tribute, the university described Miss Morgan as a "popular and well-liked student" and said support had been offered to students and colleagues who knew her.

Floral tributes dedicated to the couple were also left outside the Matalan store, which is due to reopen on Thursday.

The discovery of Miss Morgan and Mr Simmons's bodies closed part of the city centre street for several hours on Wednesday.

Some shops were also closed for much of the morning until police investigations were concluded and the street reopened at about 12:50.
