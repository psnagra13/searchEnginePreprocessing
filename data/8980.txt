The second most senior lawyer in the inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales has resigned.

News of Elizabeth Prochaska's decision to step down came after the lead counsel to the hearings, Ben Emmerson QC, was suspended on Wednesday.

The inquiry said it had become "very concerned" about aspects of Mr Emmerson's leadership of his team.

The BBC has learned Ms Prochaska left her position from 15 September, although no reason has been given.

She told BBC Newsnight's programme: "I can confirm that after 15 months working on the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, I resigned from my position as Junior Counsel with effect from 15 September 2016.

"I very much valued the experience of working with the Inquiry and I wish all my former colleagues the best as they continue their work."
