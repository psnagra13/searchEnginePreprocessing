Surgical strikes: In touch with Delhi and Islamabad, says Beijing
AS INDIA briefed envoys of 25 countries on the “surgical strikes”, China Thursday said it is in touch with India and Pakistan to bring down tension. “As for the tension between Pakistan and India, recently Chinese side has been in communication with both sides through different channels,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a media briefing in Beijing.

“We hope that India and Pakistan can enhance communication and properly deal with differences and work jointly to maintain peace and security of the region,” he said.

In Delhi, India briefed envoys of 25 countries, including the US, China, Russia, UK and France, after the Army said it had carried out “surgical strikes”.

Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar briefed the envoys to convey the “context”, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said. Jaishankar told them that it was “a classic counter-terrorism operation more than a military one” and that it was to neutralise terrorists trained to carry out attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and other Indian cities. They were told that India has no plans to carry out more operations as of now, but added that the forces will not allow terrorists to carry out attacks. Earlier, US National Security Advisor Susan Rice spoke to NSA Ajit Doval and said US wants Pakistan to “combat and delegitimise” UN-designated terrorist entities, including LeT and JeM.
