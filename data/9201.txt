Uma Bharti: Cauvery talks fail, Uma Bharti says she'll fast to prevent unrest
NEW DELHI: As a meeting convened by the Centre on the Cauvery issue failed to achieve any breakthrough, Union water resources minister Uma Bharti again appealed to both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for peace on the water sharing issue and said she may go on a hunger strike on the border of the two riparian states if there is any report of a fight between them."I am ready to sit on hunger strike, if required, to maintain peace in both the states," said Bharti after the marathon meeting that lasted for four hours. The attempt to resolve the deadlock in the meeting chaired by her failed with Tamil Nadu refusing to accept Karnataka's proposal that an expert committee be sent to the river basin to assess water availability. Karnataka wants such visits to assess the ground situation before it releases water to Tamil Nadu as directed by the Supreme Court Chief minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah and PWD minister of Tamil Nadu E K Palaniswamy along with senior officials of respective state governments attended the meeting. It was convened as per the direction of the Supreme Court. Bharti said delegation from both the states presented their views on the Cauvery water dispute. "I have noted the views expressed by both the states, which will be conveyed to the Supreme Court through the attorney general of India," she said.Terming Karnataka's proposal of sending an expert team to the river basin as "an out of box" idea which the apex court would have been "happy with", Bharti said she was disappointed that her ministry "could not fulfill the expectations" of the apex court."However, our doors will remain open whenever people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu approach us (either) through the Supreme Court or over any of their (water) projects. We are ready to cooperate to the extent possible," she said. At the meeting, Tamil Nadu accused upper riparian Karnataka of treating with "utter contempt" the SC's orders on river water sharing and defying them "deliberately and systematically".The Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, however, said Tamil Nadu is in a "more comfortable" position than his state. "It would be more appropriate, if the Union government sends a team of experts to the Cauvery basin in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to verify the ground realities, storages, inflows and outflows for taking an informed decision," he said.
