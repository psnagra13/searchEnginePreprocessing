A 12-year-old boy had bleach thrown at his eyes by bullies as he walked home from school, it has been alleged.

The victim is thought to have been saved from serious injury by his glasses in the attack in Great Barr, Birmingham.

Up to six youths reportedly restrained the schoolboy during a confrontation in the street.

West Midlands Police said the boy was not seriously hurt in last Friday's attack in Birdbrook Road at 15:50 BST.

Officers, who appealed for witnesses, are checking CCTV from the area.
