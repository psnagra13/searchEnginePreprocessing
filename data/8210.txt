Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is under fire for his controversial remarks over a Youth Congress agitation that demanded rollback of fee hike in self-financing colleges. Referring to incident where black flags were waved at him by Youth Congress workers last week, Vijayan Tuesday said in the Assembly that the protesters were hired by TV channels.

But even as enraged Opposition shouted slogans against the CM, he continued his outburst against the legislators. When the Opposition legislators trooped to the well of the House, Vijayan reportedly made a derogatory comment asking them to go away.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said Vijayan had lowered the dignity of the House by making comments that were unbecoming of his position. Senior Congress leader K Sudhakaran said there was “vulgarity” in the CM’s comments.

On Wednesday, Vijayan reiterated his charge against the media that they had hired men to wave black flags at him. “I had seen and heard such things. My experience made me to think so. I knew about the practices resorted to by media persons. I don’t find any reason to say that my notion is wrong,’’ said Vijayan.

After the CM reiterated that the incident was staged by hired men, Congress produced four Youth Congress/KSU activists who were arrested on charges of waving black flags at the Chief Minister. The arrested activists, who were later released on bail, said they would file a defamation suit against the CM for depicting them as men hired by TV channels.
