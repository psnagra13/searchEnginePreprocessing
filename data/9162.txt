Freeze on liquor policy: Kerala government decides not to close liquor outlets
The liquor policy, which envisaged total prohibition in Kerala in 10 years, is set to change with the LDF government Wednesday deciding not to close down any more retail liquor outlets on Gandhi Jayanti.

When the new liquor policy was put in place in October 2014, the then UDF government had announced closure of 10 per cent of retail outlets in the state every year in such a manner as to shut down the business in a decade. Accordingly, 52 retail outlets were closed down in the past two years and 39 outlets should have gone next week.

As the Cabinet decided to freeze the existing liquor policy, no more retail outlets will be closed down. At present, Kerala has 316 retail outlets.

Sources said some of the four-star hotels, which have recently upgraded into five-star hotels, would get liquor licence. A decision on reopening the liquor bars at four and three-star hotels will be announced after the Assembly session is over.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the shift in policy shows the nexus between CPM and bar owners.
