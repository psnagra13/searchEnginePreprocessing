After 11 rounds, FYJC Pune admissions to end today
With the 11th round of admissions for first year junior college (FYJC) finally drawing to a close on Friday, colleges heave a sigh of relief as probably the longest-ever process for Standard XI admissions ended for the current academic year. Officials of the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) committee admitted that September 30 will be the last day for FYJC admissions, at the end of five regular and six special rounds of admissions. Meenakshi Raut, assistant director of education, Pune, said the admission process was delayed this year owing to two main reasons.

“The main reason was that this year the entire admission process was completely online. This was done to ensure transparency but due to this decision, the process took longer as every single application had to be processed online. Also this year, not only did we give multiple betterment options as students were not satisfied with allotted colleges but we had to conduct additional rounds first for students who cleared SSC in August and later students who came through National Institute of Open Schooling,” she said.

She added that Friday evening marks the last day of FYJC admissions and colleges have been asked to submit a final list of students admitted as against intake capacity. While on one hand, colleges are appreciating the online process, bigger worry now is preparing the students who have come late.

“So far we have taken extra classes for students who have come in late but we still have vacant seats which means that students can still come in. Our unit tests have already been conducted so now we will have to make special arrangements for catching up on syllabus and tests,” said Dilip Sheth, principal of SP College.

Another principal said the decision to conduct supplementary exams to give a second chance to SSC failing students was good but their admissions should be planned from next year.
