Google Celebrates the 117th Birthday of Ladislao Jose Biro With A Doodle
Google today celebrates the 117th Birthday of Ladislao Jose Biro. Many might not know his name but we all certainly know his most famous invention: the ballpoint pen.14Biro was born, into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary , was a journalist by prefession. Biro noticed how efficiently newspapers were printed and how quickly the ink dried - in stark contrast to his fountain pen. He worked with his brother, Gyorgy Biro, to develop a new type of pen made up of a ball that turned in a socket. As the ball turned, it picked up ink from a cartridge and rolled to deposit it on paper, much like a newsprint roller transfers an inked image to paper.Today's google doodle shows how exactly the 1st ball point pen worked and the mechanism used behind it.Biro presented the first prototype of the ballpoint pen at the Budapest International Fair in 1931, later patenting his invention in 1938. To this day, the ballpoint pen is still referred to as the "Biro" in several countries.
