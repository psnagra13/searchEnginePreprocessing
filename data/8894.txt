Northern Lights could be visible from North Wales tonight
Stargazers across North Wales could be in with the chance to see the spectacular Aurora Borealis over the next few days.

The phenomenon may appear in the region thanks to strong solar winds.

The Aurora Borealis, otherwise known as the Northern Lights, occurs when electrically-charged particles from the Sun enter the Earth's atmosphere.

Dr. Nathan Case, from AuroraWatch UK team, said: "There is a good chance that the Northern Lights might be seen from North Wales in the next couple of nights. This increased chance is because of a coronal hole on the Sun’s surface which is blowing out fast solar wind.

"This fast solar wind, along with a favourable southward pointing magnetic field in the solar wind, means that we’re more likely to spot the aurora from the UK.

"Favourable conditions are expected to continue to until 1st October."

Weather presenter Liam Dutton tweeted there's a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights over the UK.

We need clear, dark skies which are free from light pollution and cloud cover for a good chance to see the display .
