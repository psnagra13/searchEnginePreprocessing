Tribune News Service

New Delhi, September 28

The Congress today announced a two-day signature campaign to expose the AAP government for using Rs 854 crore for self-publicity. DPCC president Ajay Maken said the signature campaign would be launched on October 8 and 9 and these days would be observed as "vasooli diwas". The signatures would be submitted to Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung informing him about the misuse of fund by the government for its publicity through advertisements. Addressing a press conference, Maken said he had filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court when the AAP government was spending crores of rupees on misleading advertisements in the media outside Delhi. The High Court had directed that a three-member committee, appointed by the Supreme Court, and headed by former Chief Election Commissioner B.B.Tandon, should probe the government's illegal expenditure on misleading advertisements outside Delhi and submit a report about it. The Tandon Committee held the government guilty of giving false and wrong advertisements. He said the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) had also found out that the government had put out false and misleading information in its advertisements at the expense of the people. The CAG, in its report, had also noted that the government had failed to provide satisfactory replies to its claim of saving Rs 350 crore in the construction of flyovers, and that it created dispensaries for Rs 5 lakh which otherwise used to cost Rs 20 lakh each. Maken said the DPCC would appeal to the Lt. Governor to charge Rs 854 crore from the AAP and deposit that amount in the exchequer. It should be spent on creating dispensaries and hospitals to improve the health care system.
