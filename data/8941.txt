The Delhi High Court today directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) not to arrest Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's son Vikramaditya who has been called for interrogation in a money laundering case registered against his father and others."You (ED) should tell your officer (before whom Vikramaditya will appeal) that no arrest should be made," Justice Vipin Sanghi said.ED counsel Sanjeev Narula maintained that the agency had no such plan and he would communicate this to the officer concerned.Taking note of the ED counsel's assurance, the bench in its order said, "In view of what has transpired in court today, no orders are being passed."Vikramaditya has been asked to appear on September 30 by ED for questioning in connection with the case following his non-appearance for interrogation earlier.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, appearing for the CM's son, contended that he apprehends that his client may be detained during questioning and he should be protected from arrest.He contended that Vikramaditya's name was not mentioned in the FIR, nor in the enforcement case investigation report (ECIR) registered by the agency.Mr Krishnan further submitted that the agency had recorded the statement of Virbhadra Singh's wife in the case last month."Vikramaditya will participate in the interrogation, but a request is made that he need not be arrested," he added.ED had also filed the first charge sheet in the case at a court in Delhi against arrested accused, LIC agent Anand Chauhan.The agency had attached assets worth about Rs 8 crore earlier this year. Virbhadra Singh had denied the allegations of any wrongdoing by him and his family.The ED had filed a case under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act after taking cognisance of a complaint filed by the CBI in this regard in September last year.The agency is probing allegations against Virbhadra Singh and his family members of having amassed wealth of Rs 6.1 crore, which is alleged to be disproportionate to his known sources of income between 2009 and 2011 when he was the Union Minister of Steel.CBI's FIR had named Virbhadra Singh, his wife, Anand Chauhan and his brother, who were all accused of violating the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
