Bathinda, September 28

Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal today launched a scathing attack on AAP, Congress and the Awaaz-e-Punjab, alleging that the leaders of all these parties were cheating the people of Punjab and politics was just a game for them. The SAD chief said his party did not need to declare its candidates and threw indications that there might not be any change in the party candidates. “The people of Punjab know who would be our candidates,” he said during an interaction with the media after inaugurating an ultra-modern dairy feed plant set up by Cargill on the Bathinda-Mansa road today. Taking on Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sukhbir said: “He is bargaining with political parties just like he bargains with TV channels. It is a mockery of politics. Earlier, he was criticising the Congress and now he is tilting towards it. If this continues, the day is not far off when he could even come to our side.” Sukhbir alleged that PPCC chief Capt Amarinder Singh did nothing for the development of Punjab. “He ruled Punjab for five years. No one can count even one project initiated by him.” On AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Sukhbir said: “Is he the CM of Delhi or Punjab? He says he will stay in Punjab for three months. If he can forget Delhi, he would also forget Punjab after the elections. Election is just a game for AAP,” he questioned. ‘Oz varsity to train players’ Faridkot: Sukhbir claimed that an agreement had been made with a university in Australia for the promotion of sports in the state. He said that the training of sportspersons in collaboration with this Australian university would help players from the state compete at the world level.
