The targets are movable targets. It means carrying out an attack and coming back without any damage to yourself," the retired general said, adding, "every single sepoy is briefed on the sketch. Everyone in the team has specific responsibility."Between midnight and 4.30 am, Indian Army para commandos attacked five to eight terrorist launch pads from one to three km inside Pakistani territory Each launch pad is estimated to have had 30 to 40 terrorists and the Army said there were "massive casualties of terrorists, their guides and handlers."The attack, sources said, took the terrorist by complete surprise.
