NIA Gets Custody Of 2 Men From Pak-Occupied Kashmir Who Facilitated Uri Attack
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) today secured 10 days' remand of two "guides" from Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) who allegedly facilitated the infiltration by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists responsible for the attack on an army camp in Uri earlier this month.The two -- Faisal Hussain Awan and Ahsaan Khursheed -- both residents of Muzaffarabad in PoK, were produced before a designated court in Jammu which remanded them in NIA's custody.The duo has since been brought to Delhi where they would be interrogated by a joint team of officials of various security agencies besides being subjected to scientific tests.During their preliminary interrogation, the two were claimed to have admitted to having facilitated infiltration by a group of four JeM terrorists who carried out the Uri army camp attack.On being shown the photographs of the four terrorists killed in retaliatory action, accused Faisal Hussain Awan identified one of them as Hafeez Ahmed, a resident of village Dharbang, Muzaffarabad, in PoK.The two were arrested in a joint operation by the BSF and the army at 'Angoor Post' at Gavalata village in Uri last Saturday when they were trying to infiltrate into India.As both were residents of PoK, the army authorities interrogated them about whether they had any knowledge regarding the Uri attack in which four terrorists had stormed an army camp on September 18 and killed 18 soldiers.The duo initially said they had inadvertently crossed over into India but during sustained interrogation were claimed to have admitted that they had facilitated the infiltration of terrorists and also helped their interrogators identify one of the terrorists involved in the Uri attack, the sources said.
