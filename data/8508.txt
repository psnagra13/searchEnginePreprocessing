india surgical strikes: Pak Army's media brand calls India's surgical strikes "cross-border" fire
NEW DELHI: After India announced on Thursday that it had conducted surgical strikes on terror launchpads across the Line of Control, the Pakistan Army's media brand Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) described the strikes as "cross-border fire."The ISPR said there had been "no surgical strike by India. Instead, India had initiated "cross-border fire," it added."The notion of a surgical strike linked to alleged terrorists bases is an illusion deliberately generated by India to create false effects," ANI quoted the ISPR as saying.The ISPR added that Pakistan had "made it clear that if there is a surgical strike on Pakistani soil," it would offer a strong response.The Pakistan Air Force too denied the nature of the strike. "This was not a surgical strike (by Indian Army). We are alert for any eventuality," it said.The Indian Army's Director General of Military Operations on Thursday said the surgical strikes across the LoC had caused many casualties on the Pakistan side, but that there were no Indian casualties.With inputs from ANI.
