Army announces strikes across LoC, Indian Twitterati cheer the ‘success’
The army announced that it had carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) on Wednesday night, taking out terror launchpads that had planned attacks in India.

Director general of military operations, lieutenant general Ranbir Singh made the announcement on Thursday afternoon, accompanied by the spokesperson for the external affairs ministry, Vikas Swarup.

The army’s offensive follows the September 18 attack on a military base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri, which killed 18 soldiers.

Almost immediately, Indians took to the micro-blogging site Twitter to commend the army and government for the action.
