Former Air Chief On Surgical Strikes
Military experts and senior retired officers have congratulated the Indian Army on the surgical strikes it conducted on Wednesday night across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent Pakistani terrorists from infiltrating into India."I think this is a fine example of the approach to address cross-border terror," said former Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, assessing the operation as "well conducted, well done and long overdue.""About time we called their bluff," Air Marshal Major said to NDTV, adding that he was glad "everything was kept under wraps till it was over."LT General Shankar Prasad (Retd) called it "great news" and complimented the Indian government for "letting the Army do what it needs.""Let Pakistan military know what we have done and will continue... A surgical attack is a very serious attack and there are multiple obstacles," the retired general said explaining that such a strike is an intricate operation as "the ground is very tough, the targets are movable targets. It means carrying out a attack and come back without any damage to yourself."Sources said there were no Indian casualties in Wednesdays strikes.The Army said the teams of terrorists were positioned on launch pads across the Line of Control to enter India and carry out attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and in big cities across the country.The strikes, DGMO Director General Military Operations Lt General Ranbir Singh said, were carried out based on specific information and that Pakistan has been duly informed about them.The DGMO accused Pakistan of "increasing infiltration of terrorists into India," saying there have been 20 attempts this year.He said recently captured terrorists have confessed to their training and arming in Pakistan and Global Positioning Systems recovered from them further established their Pakistani links.This was the first major military action taken by India after terrorists from Pakistan attacked an army camp in Uri in Kashmir earlier this month, killing 18 soldiers.
