Top-ranked Angelique Kerber has confirmed she will start 2017 at the Brisbane International tournament from Jan. 1 as she prepares to defend her Australian Open title.

Third-ranked Garbine Muguruza will also play the outdoor hard-court tournament at the Queensland Tennis Center. Rafael Nadal has previously been confirmed in the men’s draw.

Kerber will be appearing at the tournament for the fifth time. The German lost last year’s final to Victoria Azarenka.

Tournament director Geoff Quinland said “players like to repeat appearances where they have had success and Angelique has had the best year of her career.

“She is looking to again have a great year, starting in Brisbane.”

Kerber lost Wednesday for the first time since becoming the No. 1-ranked player, defeated by Petra Kvitova in the third round of the Wuhan Open.
