Two Pakistani soldiers killed in exchange of fire with India in disputed Kashmir
ISLAMABAD Two Pakistani soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire with Indian forces across the de facto border in the disputed region of Kashmir on Thursday, the Pakistani army said, as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors remain high.

The exchange of fire took place in the Bhimber, Hot Spring, Kel and Lipa sectors, and lasted about six hours early on Thursday, the Pakistani military's press wing said in a statement.

An Indian army spokesman confirmed that there had been shelling from the Pakistani side of the de facto border into the Poonch district of Indian-administered Kashmir.

Both India and Pakistan claim the disputed region of Kashmir in full, but govern over separate parts of it, divided by the Line of Control, a heavily militarized defacto border.
