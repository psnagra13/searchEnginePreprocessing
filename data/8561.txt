China Typhoon Megi: Rescuers struggle with mudslides and floods
At least 32 people are missing in China's eastern Zhejiang province after heavy rains triggered two landslides.

In Sucun village in Suichang county, several homes were swept away, leaving 26 people missing, reported state media.

The rains were caused by Typhoon Megi, which killed four people and injured 625 when it hit Taiwan at peak intensity earlier this week, before reaching mainland China.
