Kashmir attack: India 'launches strikes against militants'
India's army says it has carried out "surgical strikes" against suspected militants along the de-facto border with Pakistan in Kashmir.

The operation was aimed at preventing a series of attacks being planned by Pakistan-based militants, a senior army official told reporters.

The army said "significant casualties has been caused to these terrorists and those who are trying to support them".

Pakistan has not yet responded to the claims made by India.

It says two of its soldiers were killed in an early morning exchange of fire with Indian army units on the Line of Control dividing the disputed region.
