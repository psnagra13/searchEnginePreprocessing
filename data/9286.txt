AstroSat marks one year of successful launch in Pune
One year after the successful launch of AstroSat, the country’s first space-based observatory, a special function was organised at the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune which is a major contributor to the project besides other scientific institutes.

The event, attended by chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) A S Kiran Kumar, marked the inauguration of the AstroSat Science Support Cell (SSC) which will assist researchers, academicians and even students across the country to access the data from the satellite’s observation time through a web portal specially- designed for the purpose.

Besides this, the scientists from premier research agencies involved in different aspects of AstroSat discussed their findings over the last one year, including unique ones like the observation of rapid variability of high energy X-ray emission from a distant binary system that contains a black hole. The findings have been reported by a team led by the ISRO chairman and other scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. They said though an American satellite has in the past detected variation in low energy but it is for the first time that a satellite, AstroSat, has demonstrated the capability of seeing the variability in high energy X-rays.

“This is a unique mission and we are seeing some very interesting results come out of it. It is for the first time that we have original Indian data as so far we were relying on other sources. We are also every pleased to launch the data centre and though there will be a lock in period of about one year when the data will be first available to principal investigators only, but later on, students and researchers across India can access and analyse this data,” said Kumar.
