Bill Clinton pays his respects to Israel's Shimon Peres
Former US President Bill Clinton was among the dignitaries paying their respects as Israel's former Prime Minister and President Shimon Peres lay in state outside parliament.

Mr Peres died on Wednesday at the age of 93.

His coffin will remain in front of the parliament building in Jerusalem ahead of his funeral on Friday.

Mr Peres won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his role negotiating the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier, a prize he shared with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
