Surgical strikes across LoC signals rise of new India: Amit Shah
NEW DELHI: Surgical strikes by the Indian Army across the LoC to hit terrorist launch pads came as a huge relief for BJP that had been on the backfoot since the Uri attack . BJP hailed the PM and Indian Army, terming the action appropriate revenge for the Uri terror attack in which 18 Indian soldiers were martyred."Today's strikes signal the rise of a new India where the government doesn't get cowed down by nefarious designs of terrorists," reacted BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday. "I again salute the valour of Indian Army for giving befitting reply to those attacking innocent Indians & ensuring zero tolerance on terror," the BJP chief said.The BJP chief said it is for the first time, in a frontal fight against terrorism, India is feeling secure under the leadership of Modi. "Indian Army has inflicted heavy damage on terrorists, without any casualty and it reaffirms the Army's valour and commitment to nation's security," said Shah.There was concern that India's diplomatic and other responses would not be seen to be strong enough to satisfy an enraged public. It was also felt that BJP needed to live up to its "Bharat Mata" and "Tiranga Yatra" campaigns.In the public rally at Kozhikode in Kerala, first after the Uri attack, Modi had directly held Pakistan responsible for the terror strike and warned that perpetrators will not be spared.The Army action could be crucial even electorally with the BJP set to make noise about how it has broken the shackles that held back past governments and avenged the killing of Indian jawans. It has come as a morale-booster for the party workers in light of the looming assembly polls in five states including electorally significant Uttar Pradesh.BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, who hogged the headlines for his "jaw for tooth" comment after the Uri attack, was delighted at the success of the surgical operation. He claimed, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has walked the talk.""Punishing the perpetrators of terror from across has begun," Madhav wrote on twitter. The BJP leader took a dig at Pakistan for downplaying the surgical strikes.IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted, "Proud of our armed forces for their heroic surgical strikes on terror launch pads. Surgical strikes were conducted when Pakistan did not mend ways after repeated diplomatic efforts to check terrorism originating from their soil."
